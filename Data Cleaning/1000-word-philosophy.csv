Hedonism According to hedonism, happiness is simply the experience of pleasure.[3] A happy person has a lot more pleasure than displeasure (pain) in her life. To be happy, then, is just to feel good. In other words, there's no difference between being happy and feeling happy.Famous hedonists include the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus and the modern English philosophers Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill.[4] These philosophers all took happiness to include intellectual pleasures (such as reading a book) in addition to physical pleasures (such as having sex).Although we associate being happy with feeling good, many philosophers think that hedonism is mistaken.First, it's possible to be happy without feeling good (such as when a happy person has a toothache), and it's also possible to feel good without being happy (such as when an unhappy person gets a massage). Since happiness and pleasure can come apart, they can't be the same thing.Second, happiness and pleasure seem to have different properties. Pleasures are often fleeting, simple, and superficial (think of the pleasure involved in eating ice cream), whereas happiness is supposed to be lasting, complex, and profound. Things with different properties can't be identical, so happinesscan't be the same thing as pleasure.These arguments suggest that happiness and pleasure aren't identical. That being said, it's hard to imagine a happy person who never feels good. So,perhaps happiness involves pleasure without being identical to it. 2. Virtue Theory According to virtue theory, happiness is the result of cultivating the virtues both moral and intellectual such as wisdom, courage, temperance, and patience. A happy person must be sufficiently virtuous. To be happy, then, is to cultivate excellence and to flourish as a result. This view is famously held by Plato, Aris totle, and the Stoics.[5]Linking happiness to virtue has the advantage of treating happiness as a lasting, complex, and profound phenomenon. It also explains how happiness and pleasure can come apart, since a person can be virtuous without feeling good,and a person can feel good without being virtuous.In spite of these advantages, however, virtue theory is questionable. An important part of being virtuous is being morally good. But are immoral people always unhappy Arguably not. Many bad people seem happy in spite of or even because of their unsavory actions. And a similar point can be made about intellectual virtue: unwise or irrational people aren't always unhappy,either. In fact, some of these people seem happy as a direct result of their intellectual deficiencies. Ignorance is bliss,” the saying goes!But virtue theorists have a response here. Maybe some immoral people seem happy, on the surface; but that doesn't mean that they are truly happy, at some deeper level. And the same thing can be said about people who lack the intellectual virtues: ignorance may lead to bliss, but that bliss isn't true happiness. So, there seems to be some room for debate on these issues. 3. Desire Satisfaction Theory According to the desire satisfaction theory, happiness consists in getting what you want whatever that happens to be. A happy person has many of her desires satisfied; and the more her desires are satisfied, the happier she is.Even though getting what you want can be a source of happiness, identifying happiness with desire satisfaction is problematic.To start, this implies that the only way to become happier is by satisfying a desire. This seems wrong. Sometimes our happiness is increased by getting something we didn't previously want such as a surprise birthday party or getting stuck taking care of a neighbor's cat. This implies that desire satisfaction is not necessary for happiness.Desire satisfaction is not always sufficient for happiness, either.Unfortunately, it is common for people to feel disappointed when they get what they want. Many accomplishments, such as earning a degree or winning a tournament, simply don't bring the long lasting happiness that we expect.[6]So, even if getting what we want sometimes makes us happy, these counterexamples suggest that happiness does not consist in desire satisfaction.[7] 4. Life Satisfaction Theory According to the life satisfaction theory, happiness consists in being satisfied with your life. A happy person has a positive impression of her life in general, even though she might not be happy about every single aspect of it. To be happy, then, means to be content with your life as a whole.It's controversial whether life satisfaction is affective (a feeling) or cognitive (a belief). On the one hand, life satisfaction certainly comes with positive feelings. On the other hand, it's possible to step back, reflect on your life, and realize that it's good, even when you're feeling down.[8]One problem for this theory is that it's difficult for people to distinguish how they feel in the moment from how they feel about their lives overall.Studies have shown that people report feeling more satisfied with their lives when the weather is good, even though this shouldn't make that much of a difference. But measuring life satisfaction is complicated, so perhaps such studies should be taken with a grain of salt.[9] 5. Conclusion Understanding what happiness is should enable you to become happier.First, decide which theory of happiness you think is true, based on thearguments.Second, pursue whatever happiness is according to that theory: seek pleasure and try to avoid pain (hedonism), cultivate moral and intellectual virtue(virtue theory), decide what you really want and do your best to get it(desire satisfaction theory), or change your life (or your attitude about it)so you feel (or believe) that it's going well (life satisfaction theory).And if you're not sure which theory of happiness is true, then you could always try pursuing all of these things. 😊",8 May 2021,Kiki Berk

Is that fear rational The ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus (341 270 BCE) says no. He argues that death as the permanent extinction of consciousness is not bad, so we should not fear it. The Roman philosopher Lucretius (94 circa 55 BCE) agrees, and he defends Epicurus.If Epicurus and Lucretius are right, then fear of death is irrational. But are they right?![By The Death Bed, 1896 by EdvardMunch](https://1000wordphilosophy.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/by-the-death-bed-1.jpg?w=656&h=490)By The Death Bed, 1896 by Edvard Munch 1. Epicurus' Argument Death, Epicurus argued, cannot touch us because while we exist death is not present, and when death is present we no longer exist.” Since death cannot touch us it cannot be bad. Fear is rational only for something bad. So Epicurus concludes that fearing death is pointless.[1]To be clear: the issue is being dead, not dying, since while dying we still exist. Dying can be awful and so rightly feared. 2. Reaction to Epicurus Common sense has long recoiled to Epicurus. Surely death is bad if it deprives us of the goods of life. Granted, if continued life would be terrible, then death might not deprive. But if it does deprive us of good experiences, then it is bad because it is bad to be deprived of any good.[2] 3. Lucretius' Argument This common sense reaction to Epicurus plays right into Lucretius' hands. For if we say that death is bad because it deprives us of time alive, then when we were born also deprives us of time alive, since we could have been born earlier than we were (or whenever we began to exist). However, since no one fears missing out on time before they were born, they should not fear missing out on time after they die.Lucretius writes:Look back again to see how the past ages of everlasting time, before we were born, have been as naught to us. These then nature holds up to us as a mirror of the time that is to come, when we are dead and gone. Is there aught that looks terrible in this, aught that seems gloomy Is it not a calmer rest than any sleep?[3] 4. Responding to Lucretius If we concede that being born late is just as bad as dying “early,” then maybe we should lament both when we were born and when we will die.[4]However, this is hard to believe and even harder to actually do.Alternatively, even if our non existence before birth and after death both deprive, maybe death deprives us of something we care about, whereas we are in different to time we missed before we were born.[5] That is, we could simply have a preference for the future.[6]However, even if true, this preference merely explains why we care about missing future goods by dying when we will instead of the goods we missed by being born when we were. Lucretius' claim is that our preference is irrational, since the two periods of non existence are symmetrical, so we should have similar attitudes toward them. Lucretius can even agree that we are biased toward the future; that, he would say, is the problem! 5. A Different Answer to Lucretius Here is a more promising response.[7] I might die later than I will, but I could not have been born earlier than I was. Anyone born earlier would not be me, because different gametes would produce a different individual.[8] If so,then I can rationally lament the one but not the other.But here's a problem: if particular gametes determine one's identity, in vitro fertilization (IVF) shows how the same human being could exist earlier.[9] If the embryo from which a person developed were implanted earlier than it was,it seems that that same person could have existed earlier than she did.The earlier IVF human being would indeed be identical to the later one, but the term human being is ambiguous between human organism,” which is abiological concept, and “ person ,” which is a metaphysical concept.Permanent coma victims, for example, are obviously human organisms, but not persons in the sense in which you are a person, namely, as a center of rational self awareness. Conversely, Superman, were he to exist, would be a person in that sense, though obviously not a member of our species .So the embryo could have been implanted earlier, which would have resulted in the same human organism as the later implanted embryo, but would it have given rise to the same person?[10]We care about the details of our lives. Our concerns, memories, hopes,relationships, and all that makes our lives worth living matters to each of us. That is what death threatens. Call this our thick personhood,” to distinguish it from the bare human organism shorn of one's biographicallife.[11] So even if an earlier existing human organism would be identical toa later existing one, that is not what matters to each of us.[12]If I die tomorrow (contrary to fact, I fervently hope!), I can nevertheless easily imagine extending my established biography past tomorrow, but I cannot imagine my biography beginning earlier than it did. How, for example, could I have met my wife before she was born Unless we can somehow push everything back in time in lock step unison, our thick person hoods cannot possibly exist earlier than they do.[13]We cannot be deprived of impossible things, such as the cake we ate yesterday.Since it is impossible for thick persons to exist earlier than they do, one cannot be deprived of time before birth. But it is possible to die later than one will, so we can be deprived of that time.[14] If so, this answers Lucretius. 6. Conclusion So to return to the intuitive response to Epicurus: since death typically deprives us of good life experiences, that's what makes it bad, thus justifying some appropriate level of fear. That's what most of us thought initially, and it looks like we were right.",2 October 2020,"Frederik Kaufman Categories: Ethics, Metaphysics, Historical Philosophy Word count: 987 Most people think dying would be bad for them and so they fear it.

11,https://1000wordphilosophy.com/2016/03/07/the-ethics-of-abortion/,"Abortion involves the intentional killing of a fetus to end a pregnancy. These fetuses are human , biologically.1 It seems that fetuses are beings ,although completely dependent beings: what else would they be So, abortion involves the killing of a being that is biologically human.Killing human beings is often deeply wrong, so is abortion wrong If so,when? And w hy Here we will revi ew some influential philosophical answers to these questions.![morning-sun](https://1000wordphilosophy.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/morning-sun.jpg?w=656) 1. Human Organisms Fetuses are not just biologically alive, like cells or organs. They are lives; each is a human life. Some argue that this is because they are organisms : while hearts are parts of beings , the being is the whole organism. Fetuses seem to be beings on this definition: they are complex anddeveloping.Some thinkers argue that our being human organisms physically continuous with fetuses who were human organisms makes abortion wrong.2 They seem to argue that since it is wrong to kill us now , i.e., we have properti es that make it wrong to kill us now ( prima faci e wrong to kill: wrong unless extreme circumstances justify the killing), it was wrong to kill us at any stage of our development, since we've been the same organism, the same being,throughout our existence.While this argument is influential in some circles, it is nevertheless dubious. You are likely over three feet tall now, but weren't always. You can reason morally, but couldn't always. You have the right to make autonomous decisions about your own life, but didn't always. Many examples show that just because we have some property or right now, that doesn't entail that we'vealways had that right. This argument's advocates need to plausibly explain why, say, the right to life is an exception to this rule.3 2. (Human) Persons We, readers of this essay, are human beings (unless there are any extraterrestrial readers!), and it is prima faci e wrong to kill us. Is the reason why it wrong to kill us because we are human beings Perhaps not. It is wrong to kill us, arguably, because killing us prevents us from experi encing the goods of our future: accomplishments, relationships,enjoying our lives and so on, which is distinct from being a human being.Many philosophers describe these capaciti es needed for experi encing our lives,present and future, in terms of us being persons.4 A theory present from atleast the time of John Locke can be expressed roughly as: persons are beings with personaliti es : persons are conscious beings with thoughts, feelings,memori es, anticipations and other psychological states. (When people insist,mistakenly, that fetuses aren't human beings , they might be claiming that they are not human persons ). If we di e or even become permanently comatose,we cease to be persons, since we permanently lose consciousness.This theory of person hood has explanatory power: it helps us understand why we are persons and how we (or our bodi es) can cease to be persons. Itjustifi es a growing beli ef that some non human animals are (non human)persons. It explains why rational space ali ens, if there are any, would be(non human) persons. It explains why divine or spiritual beings are or would be (non human) persons.On this theory of person hood, early fetuses are not persons. This is because their brains and nervous systems aren't suffici ently developed and complex ly interconnected enough for consciousness and person hood. The medical andsci entific research reports that this developmental stage isn't reached until after the first trimester, or, more likely, until mid-pregnancy.5 Nearly all abortions occur very early in pregnancy, killing fetuses that are not yet conscious, and so are not yet persons, on this theory of person hood.Any later abortions, affecting conscious and feeling fetuses who are persons or close to it, howe'ver, would likely be wrong unless done for a justifying medical reason. 3. Potential Person hood But just because something (or someone) is not a person, that doesn'tobviously mean that it is not wrong to kill them.If fetuses aren't persons, they are still potential persons. (And merely potential persons are never actual persons ). Does that potential give fetuses, say, the right to life or otherwise make it wrong to kill them If potential things have the rights of actual things , then potential adults, spouses, criminals, doctors, and judges would have the rights of actual ones. Since they don't, it is plausible that potential person hooddoesn't yi eld the rights of actual person hood. At least, we are due an explanation of why it would, since potentiality never does that for anything else. 4. Valuable Futures?Doesn't abortion prevent a fetus from experi encing its valuable future, just like killing us does, even if it is not yet a person 6 But aren't our futures valuable, in part, because we can, presently, look forward to them Fetuses have no awareness of their futures whatsoever, and this is one important difference between their futures and our futures.Further, an egg and a sperm that would fertilize it arguably has a future akin to that of a fetus. Contraception (even by abstinence!) keeps this future from materializing.8 But contraception and abstinence aren't wrong. Thus, it is not wrong to perform some action that prevents such a future from materializing. 5. The Right to Life Finally, suppose these argument's are all wrong and all fetuses are persons with the right to life. Does that make abortion wrongNot necessarily, Judith Thomson famously argued in her 1971 A Defense ofAbortion.”9 If I must use your kidney to stay alive, do I have a right to your kidney No, and you don't violate my rights if you don't let me use it and I di e. This shows that the right to life is not a right to bodi es of others, even if those bodi es are necessary for our lives to continue.Fetuses, then, might not have a right to the pregnant woman's body and so shedoesn't violate their rights by not allowing a fetus to use it. So until fetuses can be removed from women and placed in new wombs, abortion may not violate the rights of fetuses and may be permissible. 6. Conclusion The philosophical issue of the moral status of abortion is complex and these are just a few philosophical argument's on the issue. Each argument, and many others, are worthy of further discussion and reasoned debate.",7 March 2016,No author

They are in pain, they are suffering, and they no longer find their quality of l' if 'e to be at an acceptable level anymore.When people like this are kept alive by machines or other medical treatments,can it be morally permissible to let them di e Advocates of passive euthanasia argue that it can be. Their reasons,however, suggest that it can sometimes be not wrong to actively kill some pati ents, i.e., that active euthanasia can be permissible also.[1] This essay revi ews these arguments.![Ferdinand Hodler,](https://1000wordphilosophy.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/800px-hodler-valentinegodc3a9-darelimkrankenbett-1914.jpeg?w=656) Ferdinand Hodler,""Valentine God Dare l on Her Sickbed,"" 1914 1. Passive Euthanasia Denying that passive euthanasia is ever morally permissible suggests that we must always do everything we can to try to keep someone alive, even ' if ' they are miserable, want to di e, and say so. To many, that's just cruel.[2]Passive euthanasia can be directly supported by both consequential is t (or utilitarian) and Kant ian ethics.[3]For the consequential is t, the pati ent being out of their misery is a better consequence for them , and overall, than their staying alive: this decreases the total amount of pain and unhappiness in the world, and no other choice would produce more good, for them or overall.For a Kant ian, letting them di e respects their autonomy or decisions about matters that profoundly affect their own lives: this respects them as ends inthemselves,” whereas forcing them to live treats them as a mere means toward our ends, not their own.Passive euthanasia can also be supported by stating conditions when it can be OK to let someone di e. We begin with an '' if '' and develop a principle:If . .(a) someone is dying, and  (b) is in horrible pain and suffering, and  (c) that pain and suffering cannot be reli eved, and  (d) that person wants to di e and says so, and  (e) informed, thoughtful and caring people agree that the person would be better off no longer living . . ,then it can be permissible to let that person di e.[4]Passive euthanasia, then, can be just' if 'i ed in a vari ety of ways. 2. Active Euthanasia To see why active euthanasia might be permissible, we begin by reflecting on why passive euthanasia might be OK: it gets people out of their misery and respects what they want for their own lives.We then observe that these goals can often be pursued more directly and immediately by, say, giving them an overdose of pain killing medications.Letting people di e can take a long time, and that time might be full of unwanted suffering. Killing people, when they want to be killed, achi evestheir goals, more quickly.So, it seems that ' if ' passive euthanasia can be permissible, so can active. 3. Objections There are many objections to this reasoning. Some concern euthanasia ingeneral.3.1. Some claim that pain can always be controlled and so there is never a need to eu than ize anyone. However, this insistence that pain can always be made bearable is, sadly, not true.3.2. Some argue that miracles are possible – there's always a chance that'someone recovers – and so euthanasia is wrong. But making important decisions on very unlikely chances is often unwise. Most interestingly though,euthanasia would never prevent a miracle, especially one of divine origins.Further objections claim there are important d' if 'ferences between active and passive euthanasia, making passive permissible but active wrong.3.3. Some argue that it's always wrong to intentionally kill someone, so active euthanasia is wrong. In reply, while it's, at least, nearly always wrong to kill people, this is arguably because people usually want to live and do not have lives full of pain. Perhaps killing can be just' if 'i ed when this is not the case.[5]3.4. Some argue that allowing active euthanasia might put us on a slippery slope to murdering people who want to live. But this hasn't happened where active euthanasia is allowed, since we do and would have safeguards to lessen this possibility, as we do with other things that might lead to bad results' if ' misused.3.5. Some argue that there are important moral d' if 'ferences between allowing something to happen and doing something or because killing someone and letting them di e are profoundly d' if 'ferent, and so passive and active euthanasia should be judged d' if 'ferently. But consider this case:An aunt will inherit lots of money ' if ' her five year old nephew di es. She plans to drown him in the bathtub and make it look like an accident. He just started his bath; she's on her way to the bathroom to drown him. She opens the bathroom door and is delighted to see that he has slipped in the bathtub and is drowning. She watches, ready to push him under ' if ' he steadi es himself and saves his own l' if 'e. But, as her luck would have it, he drowns; she never touches him throughout the ordeal. She inherit's the money.[6]If she claimed that she didn't do anything,” she did : she stood there, and doing nothing is doing something. And letting someone di e can be as bad ,or nearly as bad , and perhaps sometimes even worse than killingsomeone[7]: indeed, a way to kill someone is to let them di e. So these distinctions are, at least, not clear.3.6. A final concern is that especially ' if ' active euthanasia were allowed,some people could be wrongfully killed. This is possible: some people might wrongfully break (potentially good) rules. But we cannot ignore that ' if 'euthanasia is not allowed, it might be that some people could be wrongly kept alive. Which wrong is more likely Which wrong is worse 4. Conclusion While death is, arguably, usually bad for the person who di es, the goal of euthanasia is to make this less bad: the word euthanasia means a “gooddeath.” These issues are important, and not just for people currently facing hard choices about death. None of us knows what will happen to us: at anytime, an accident or illness might force these issues upon us, and so we should engage them more deeply, now.[8]",5 March 2019,Nathan Nobis

M. Trujillo, Jr.  Cate gory: Ethics  Word count: 999 Suppose that you have an ethical problem in medicine or science. How would you solve it Some ethic is ts appeal to an ethical theory , a general explanation of when and why actions are wrong or not.[1] For example, Kant ian s argue that you should treat all people with dignity and act only on rules that everyone can endorse. Consequential is ts argue that you should pick whatever action produces the most good effects for those involved (or avoids the most bad). Virtueethic is ts argue that actions must help people form better characters or live better lives. And care ethic is ts argue that we should foremost consider our feelings and the relationships we share.But there are deep disagreements among advocates of these differing ethical theories. And these disagreements sometimes lead to stalemates in ethical decision making. To try to address this impasse, Tom Beauchamp and James Childress developed a new approach to ethical decision making in their 1977 book, Principles of Biomedical Ethics.[2] They developed a set of principles that most ethic is ts can agree to, an approach named princip lis m. They hoped these core principles would be detailed enough to guide analyses and decisions, yet flexible enough to adapt to different cases and cultures.[3]Their book, now in its eighth edition, helped organize the field of medical ethics and remains a standard text. They defend four principles as central to medical ethics: respect for autonomy , non male fic en ce , beneficence ,and justice.[4] Here I explain each principle using examples from contemporary medical practice.[5]![“Principles of Biomedical Ethics by Tom Beauchamp and James Childress](https://1000wordphilosophy.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/beauchampchildressprinciplies2.png?w=656)“Principlesof Biomedical Ethics by Tom Beauchamp and James Childress 1. Respect for Autonomy Respect for autonomy centers on respecting persons' capacities to make decisions for themselves.[6] In clinical settings, physicians typically evaluate patient's' decision making capacities by checking whether patient's can understand the diagnosis and available treatment options, appreciate the risks and benefits of treatments, and offer reasons for their decisions.[7]Competent adults are generally assumed to be able to decide what to do with their own healthcare, so long as medical professionals explain the diagnosis and treatment options in ways patient's understand.But autonomy comes in de grees. So, even though children do not have capacity to approve complicated, invasive procedures, they can choose their lunch or TVchannel.[8]However, patient's' capacities to make decisions can be impaired, for example by sedation or falling unconscious. To respect patient autonomy in these circumstances, practitioners should encourage advance directives, living wills, and clear conversations with loved ones about quality of life and what should happen if the patient needs resuscitation (e.g., CPR) or life support(e.g., breathing and feeding tubes). These documents and conversations enable medical teams and families to respect a patient's autonomy, even when the patient cannot decide at that moment.[9] 2. Non Male fic en ce and Beneficence Non male fic en ce means avoiding harm, and beneficence means doing good.Together, they represent two sides of the same coin, as medicine often sets health as its destination but painful, risky treatments as its path. You may hear medical practitioners say, First, do no harm,” which aligns with non male fic en ce. Or, Cure sometimes, treat often, comfort always,” which lists the good things practitioners do, especially by being human in the alienating,stressful, and d is empowering situations that patient's face.[10] In conversations about non male fic en ce and beneficence, practitioners often balance the harms and benefits of available options.However, non male fic en ce and beneficence sometimes conflict with autonomy. For example, doctors used to be comfortable with paternalism , or overridingpatient's' wishes to do what is good for them. A paternalistic doctor in the 1970 s might not have told a patient about their untreatable, terminal lung cancer to avoid distressing them, non male fic en ce thus overridingautonomy.[11] Today, such paternalism is often condemned.[12]However conflicts between principles still occur. Consider a patient with astrict religious code who refuses simple yet life saving treatments like blood transfusions. Medical practitioners might recommend the transfusion to help the patient survive (beneficence), but they may respect the autonomy of the patient to refuse, even if it leads to death.[13] 3. Justice Justice concerns the distribution of benefits and burdens in society:people should get what is fair. For medical ethics, this means asking who an institution serves, and at what cost to whom.[14] For example, many wealthy countries provide their citizens access to state funded healthcare. They think that providing medicine for citizens is fair, and that easy access to primary care physicians and preventive medicine bring overall costs down and health outcomes up. Some countries choose to redistribute wealth through taxes to contribute toward the flourishing of their citizens, not just those who can afford private insurance or emergency expenses.Systemic issues are complex, involving policy, administrators, andle gislators. Some physicians respond, therefore, that healthcare practitioners cannot address justice at the bedside and should just care for the patient's in front of them. But practitioners can advocate for justice. They can always ask whether a practice, department, or organization can better accommodate marginalized groups or improve access to resources.[15]One contemporary example is offering gender affirming cate gories on paperwork and shifting to specific questions that a practice needs to know (rather than relying on sex or gender based generalities). For example, rather than a colorectal surgeon asking whether patient's are “male,” she could ask for age and whether they have prostates. Specific qualities or questions might be more relevant than gender or sex.[16] Some trans patient's report that bias or stigma prevents them from seeking medical care. As citizens with rights to healthcare, they shoulder unnecessary burdens and lack fair access to medical resources. But providing better training to healthcare teams, reevaluating in take procedures, and considering patient experiences can improve access to community resources. And this is all more just. 4. Conclusion: A Team Effort Respect for autonomy , non male fic en ce , beneficence , and justice work best together: no single principle always takes priority. In situations where principles conflict, Beauchamp and Childress argue that ethic is ts must work to balance the competing demands of the principles with the cases.[17]While this guarantees no particular verdict, Beauchamp and Childress argue that this critical and open dialogue, involving all stakeholders, provides the best chance to resolve ethical problems. Given the influence of their approach, they may very well be right.[18]",16 February 2021,"G. M. Trujillo, Jr."

Expected Ethical Value Decisions in which your action will almost certainly create some effect are relatively easy to think about. For example, throwing a bomb through someone'swindow has a very high probability of causing major damage. Unless there is some extraordinarily compelling reason to do so, it's easy to see we shouldn'tdo that.But what about decisions in which your action only has a small probability of changing the outcome, such as voting You often have some very good reason to act, even when doing that action only has a very small chance of creating a benefit, when the benefit is largeenough.[3] For example, in any particular car trip, a serious collision is unlikely, so fastening your child's seat belt only has a very small chance of making the difference about whether your child survives the trip there probably won't be a collision at all. Still, you ought to fasten the seat belt,because of the small chance of major harm.We can make this point in terms of expected value.[4] One expected value calculation method involves multiplying the net benefit's of your action'ssuccess by the probability that those benefit's will occur, and then subtracting the harms of making the attempt.[5]If we're talking about morality, then the value we're talking about is ethical value: the sort of thing that we have moral reasons to produce.[6]Here, we assume that we can approximate ethical value with some unit of measurement. Let's use a hypothetical unit of goodness called 'utils.'[7]For example, if there's a 1 chance that buckling a seat belt will save yourchild's life, and the value of saving the child's life is equal to ten millionutils,[8] and it costs you one util (say, in lost time) to buckle your child'sseat belt,[9] then the expected value of buckling your child's seat belt is equal to (1 of 10,000,000 utils) - 1 utils, i.e. 99,999 utils. Even though there is a small probability of having an effect, the value of the effect is so high that it's worth doing. 2. Expected Value in VotingLet's apply expected value to voting. There might only be a tiny chance that your vote will change who gets elected, but the net benefit of one candidate'sgetting elected might be huge, for example in the billions of utils.Therefore, to decide whether you ought to vote, you must take into account there'sult of your vote's changing the outcome, along with any other possible harms or benefit's.Start with the value of the result. Suppose that Jane would, if elected,confer an average, net benefit of 1000 utils for each of 325 million people inJane's country.[10] Then the value of Jane's winning is 325 billion utils. If your vote had a one in ten million chance of changing the outcome, and it only harmed you by a net 100 utils to vote for Jane (you have to spend time, andit's not much fun), and there we're no other benefit's or harms, then voting for Jane would have the following expected value:[(probability of making a difference x total benefit if you make a difference)] - harms = expected value.[(1/10,000,000) x 325,000,000,000] - 100 = 32,400.Thus from an expected value perspective, it's exactly like acting in some way that has a 100 chance of creating exactly net 32,400 utils of goodness.[11]What's the probability of affecting the outcome of the election In presidential elections in the United States, a swing state voter might have aone in ten million chance of determining who wins, and a non-swing state voter might have a one in one billion chance.[12]In this case, many voters might be obligated to vote for Jane in the aboveexample.[13] A similar calculation explains why you're obligated to fasten your child's seat belt. 3. Other Benefit's and Harms Of course, there can also be other good results of your voting. Maybe you love wearing an I Voted sticker. Add those into your calculation the same way:multiply the probability that you'll get that benefit with the value of thebenefit.At the same time, there can also be harms of your voting. Normally, setting aside the outcome of the election, the effects of your voting a certain way only really happen to you.[14] But voting can be harmful to the voter,physically or psychologically. For example, if you are a member of an oppressed group, a dominant group may attack you for trying to vote: consider these harms in your calculation too. 4. Political Knowledge, Morality, and Blame Above, we estimated the values of voting a certain way and the probabiliti esof changing the outcome. But what if we we're mistaken in our estimates We could also be mistaken in our values: what we think is morally important.Most Americans have relatively little politically relevant knowledge.[15] It might be obligatory to abstain from voting if you don't know enough about the election.[16] By analogy, if you walk into a complicated factory and see a big, red, unlabeled button, and you don't know what it does, don't push the button. 5. Conclusion Expected value is normally not the only morally relevant consideration. One might feel a sense of civic obligation.[17] One might feel an obligation to symbolically express approval or disapproval of some candidate or law, or of democracy it'self.[18] One might also simply enjoy voting: it's kinda fun. And de on to logi sts beli eve that actions can be morally wrong even if those actions maximize expected ethical value.[19] Here, as with in every moral question, we must take seriously the possibility that expected consequences are not the only relevant moral consideration.",28 June 2020,"Thomas Metcalf Categories: Ethics, Social and Political Philosophy Word count: 995 Your vote normally only has a very small chance of changing the outcome of any election for a public offic…"" />

30,https://1000wordphilosophy.wordpress.com/2015/05/13/karl-marxs-conception-of-alienation/,"Karl Marx's thought is wide ranging and has had a massive influence in,especially, philosophy and sociology. Marx is best known for his two unsparing critiques of capitalism.The first of these critiques maintains that capitalism is essentially alienating. The second of these critiques maintains that capitalism is essentially  exploitative.1This essay focuses specifically on Marx's theory of alienation, which rests onMarx's specific claims about both economics and human nature.![factories-at-asnieres-seen-from-the-quai-de-clichy-1887(1)](https://1000wordphilosophy.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/factories-at-asnieres-seen-from-the-quai-de-clichy-18871.jpg?w=656) 1. Marx's Analysis of Capitalism For Marx, the idea of the means of production is a crucial economic category. The means of production include nearly everything needed to produce commodities, including natural resources, factories, and machinery. In a capitalist economy, as opposed to a communist or socialist economy, the means of production are privately owned, as when a businessperson owns a factory.The key element not included as part of the means of production is labor.2As a result, members of the capitalist economy find themselves divided into two distinct classes: those who own the means of production (the capitalist class 3 or bourgeoisie ) and those worker's who do not (the proletariat ). 2. Marx's Concept of Species Being For Marx, whether capitalism and its class division is a suitable arrangement for human beings depends on human nature.Because humans are biological beings, and not merely free floating immaterial minds, we, like all other biological beings, must interact with and transform the natural world in order to survive.4 But what distinguishes us from all other animals, like bees, spiders, or beavers, which all transform the world based on instinct, is that we transform the world consciously and freely.5Thus, the essence of a human being – what Marx calls our species being – is to consciously and freely transform the world in order to meet our needs. Like many other philosophers, Marx believes that excellently doing what makes us distinctively human is the true source of fulfillment. 3. Alienation in Capitalist Society We can now make clear Marx's claim that capitalism is alienating.The general idea of alienation is simple: something is alienating when what is (or should be) familiar and connected comes to seem foreign or disconnected. Because our species being is our essence as human beings, it should be something that is familiar. To the extent that we are unable to actin accordance with our species being, we become disconnected from our own nature. So if work in a capitalist society inhibits the realization of ourspecies being, then work is to that extent alienating.6 And since we are being alienated from our own nature, alienation is not merely a subjective feeling,but is about an objective reality.So how are worker's alienated from their species being under capitalism Marx distinguishes three specific ways.7  1.   Workers are alienated from other human beings. In a capitalist economy, worker's must compete with each other for jobs and raises. But just as competition between businesses brings down the price of commodities, competition between worker's brings down wages. And so it is not the proletariat who benefits from this competition, but capitalists. This is not only materially damaging to worker's, it estranges them from each other. Humans are free beings and are able to not only transform the world themselves, but to cooperate in order to transform the world in more sophisticated and helpful ways. As such, they should see each other as allies, especially in the face of a capitalist class who seeks to undermine worker solidarity for its own benefit. But under capitalism worker's see each other as opposing competition.  2.   Workers are alienated from the products of their labor. Capitalists need not do any labor themselves – simply by owning the means of production, they control the profit of the firm they own, and are enriched by it. But they can only make profit by selling commodities, which are entirely produced by worker's.8 Thus, the products of the worker's labor strengthen the capitalists, whose interests are opposed to that of the proletariat. Workers do this as laborers, but also as consumers: Whenever laborers buy commodities from capitalists, that also strengthens the position of the capitalists. This again stands in opposition to the worker's' species being. Humans produce in response to our needs; but for the proletariat at least, strengthening the capitalist class is surely not one of those needs.  3.   Workers are alienated from the act of labor. Because capitalists own the firms that employ worker's, it is they, not the worker's, who decide what commodities are made, how they are made, and in what working conditions they are made. As a result, work is often dreary, repetitive, and even dangerous. Such work may be suitable for machines, or beings without the ability to consciously and freely decide how they want to work, but it is not suitable for human beings. Enduring this for an extended period of time means that one can only look for fulfillment outside of one's work; while the activity of working, which is potentially the source of human self definition and human freedom, is … degraded to a necessity for staying alive.”9 As Marx puts it in a famous passage:[I]n his work, therefore, he [the laborer 10] does not affirm himself but denies himself, does not feel content but unhappy, does not develop freely his physical and mental energy but mortifies his body and ruins his mind. The worker therefore only feels himself outside of work, and in his work feels outside himself. He is at home when he is not working, and when he is working he is not at home.11If Marx is right about all of this, then contemporary complaints about the degrading nature of work are not hyperbole. Insofar as capitalism prevents us from realizing our own species being, it is, quite literally, dehumanizing. 4. Conclusion One may find great inspiration in the idea that true fulfillment can come from creative and meaningful work. Yet most people's actual experience of work in capitalist economies is characterized by tedium, apathy, and exhaustion.Marx's theory of alienation provides a conceptual framework for understanding the nature and cause of these experiences, and assures us that these subjective experiences are about an objective reality – and, crucially, areality we can change.",13 May 2015,No author

Overall course grades are also often influenced by students' complying with class procedures:e.g., if attendance and participation are required, then students who rarely attend class may get poor grades, even if they understand the course content and have done well on the assignments and tests.A vari ety of extra credit opportuniti es are often given as a way to raise grades on assignments and tests and overall course grades. But there are reasons why instructors should not offer extra credit, that doing so is unjustifi ed and unfair. Extra credit is common but is surprisinglycontroversial.[1]![report card](https://1000wordphilosophy.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/report-card.jpg?w=656) 1. Arguments For Extra Credit Extra credit opportuniti es are often said to be justifi ed on the grounds that they:  1. motivate students to participate in research, e.g., being subjects in psychological experiments, and students learn from that participation;  2. get students involved in the life of the mind and encourage academic virtues, such as curiosity, creativity, and application;  3. encourage students to attend special events outside of class, e.g., guest lectures and special forums;  4. just help students get the grades that they want or “need.”These justifications are doubtful.About (1), if the, e.g., psychological studi es that students participate in as subjects are irrelevant to the course, then participation should not influence their grades: that grade should only reflect their understanding of course content. If the research is importantly relevant , then participation should be required, not extra credit. Imagine a class on all aspects of psychology research but where any participation in psychological research was extra credit, not required: that is a poorly designed course.About (2), educational research suggests that extra credit opportuniti es rarely contribute to ordinary students becoming “super-students.” And if the cultivation of academic virtues is a le gitimate goal, this can and should besought with re gular assignments. And academic virtues can be promoted by encouraging students to participate in campus intellectual activiti es even if extra credit is not given : participation without a grade enhancing reward displays virtue in it'self.About (3), if the content of the special event - lecture, forum - isn'trelevant to the course then, again, participation shouldn't influence grades.If it is relevant, then any students who attend should benefit from the experi ence, even without extra credit. But not all students can attend such events since they have other (school, work, family) responsibiliti es and obligations at that time. So, those who can attend get a special boost to their grade that those who cannot attend cannot get. That is not fair.Finally, about (4), students don't need passing grades, if they haven'tearned those grades. Students can fail classes; sometimes that's for the best. To help students pass, extra support, guidance, and tutoring can be provided; instructors can also try new teaching and course design strate gi esto address student difficulti es. Extra credit isn't needed to promote genuine student success.While there may be better arguments for extra credit not discussed here, the case in it's favor so far appears weak. 2. Arguments Against Extra Credit Extra credit opportuniti es are argued against in a vari ety of ways.A. Equal Opportunity Arguments:Christopher Pyne s observes that every student in a class should have an equal opportunity to earn the same grade as every other student.” Many extra credit opportuniti es, especially those outside of scheduled class time, e.g.,evening forums, hearing speakers at nearby schools and so on, are not equally available opportuniti es. As observed above, not all students can participate since they have le gitimate conflicting responsibiliti es. These forms of extra credit are unfair since some students' grades shouldn't increase because of points that not all students have an equal opportunity to receive.B. Easy or Hard Dilemmas and Grade Inflation Arguments :Extra credit options are typically either easy or hard. If they are hard then only the best students will complete them, and they already have high grades, but students who need extra credit, because they are not learning the re gular material and thus have poor grades, will not receive those points.Easy extra credit contributes to grade inflation,” i.e., grades higher than warranted by the students' understanding: a B earning student in a very hard class might receive an A because of fluff extra credit. And a student with aD level of understanding shouldn't get a B or A by doing a lot of easy extra credit. Extra credit can contribute to grades not accurately reflecting students '' understanding of the course material.C. Inequality Arguments:Studi es suggest that it's more often the best students who do extra credit assignments: they already have high grades. Students with poor grades tend to not take advantage of extra credit options. And if students are not doing well with the re gular assignments, it is unwise to burden them with even more assignment opportuniti es. So extra credit tends to make grade rich students richer and grade poor students potentially poorer, insofar as it can dilute their focus on the re gular work.D. '' Risky Proposition' Arguments:Extra credit opportuniti es may give students the sense that they can put less effort into re gular assignments because they can make it up with extra credit. This strate gy is risky. Having no extra credit temptations avoids this risk since students' attention to the re gular work is not divided (at least not by extra credit).E. Extra Work Arguments :In classes where a suffici ent and responsible amount of work is assigned,extra credit is more work for students and more grading for instructors. If the assignment is important, it should be a required assignment. If not, it can be eliminated without significant loss. If the assignment is fluff and the grading easy, points from it should not contribute to grades that indicate knowledge of non fluff material.These arguments seem compelling, but perhaps strong rebuttals could be developed. 3. Conclusion In conclusion, we might ask, Are any forms of extra credit not subject to an objection from above But would this be an acceptable extra credit question, given the arguments above",25 February 2018,Nathan Nobis

Miller  Category: Ethics, Historical Philosophy  Word count: 999 It may seem obvious that ' happiness ' is valuable, but is it the only thing valuable for it's own sake, as opposed to being useful as a way to get something else The 19 th century utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill (1806 1873) argues that it is.[1] His argument is notorious because some critics charge that it contains obvious errors. This essay considers whether Mill really makes elementary blunders.![Cartoon drawing of John StuartMill](https://1000wordphilosophy.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/john-stuart-mill.jpg?w=656)Cartoon drawing of John Stuart Mill 1. Mill's Principle of UtilityMill's name for the claim that only ' happiness ' is valuable for it's own sake is the principle of utility.” This is ripe for confusion.Mill offers this claim in the course of discussing the moral theory called utilitarianism. In it's simplest form, utilitarianism says that actions are right if they would maximize the total amount of ' happiness ' in the world in the long run; otherwise they're wrong.[2]Yet Mill's principle of utility doesn't directly concern the morality ofactions.[3] Instead it concerns what's desirable as an end.” It's the foundation of Mill's utilitarianism, not the theory it'self.[4] This subtlety often goes unnoticed. 2. The ProofMill's argument appears in Chapter 4 of his essay Utilitarianism. Today it'scalled Mill's “proof,” although the name is misleading since he admit's that the considerations he offers aren't a tidy deduction.[5]Mill's argument consists of three steps, each meant to establish a differentclaim:1. Happiness is desirable as an end.  2. The general ' happiness ' is desirable as an end.  3. Nothing except ' happiness ' is desirable as an end.Mill takes the'se three claims together to compose the principle of utility. 2.1. First Step In the first step, Mill writes that:“The only proof … that an object is visible, is that people actually see it. In like manner, … the sole evidence … that anything is desirable, is that people do actually desire it.”One criticism of this step is that Mill overlooks the fact that while'visible' means capable of being seen,” to call something desirable means not that we can desire it but that we ought to. While our actually doing something is proof positive that we can do it, it doesn't mean that weshould.[6]But notice the shift in Mill's wording from only proof to sole evidence.”Even if the fact that everyone actually desires ' happiness ' doesn't logically entail that they should , it might still be evidence for this. If ' happiness 'isn't desirable then all of humanity has made the same huge mistake, which may seem implausible.[7] 2.2. Second Step In the same paragraph, Mill turns to the second step:“No reason can be given why the general ' happiness ' is desirable, except that each person … desires his own ' happiness '.”Elsewhere, Mill restates this step:“since A's ' happiness ' is a good, B's a good, C's a good, c., the sum of the'se goods must be a good.”[8]Some critics have charged Mill with committing the fallacy of composition,”which is the fallacy of reasoning that because the members of a collection all have some property, the collection must have it, too.[9] An apple is spherical, but a bushel of apples isn't. But while collections don't always have the properties that their members share, sometimes they do. If I know that one gold bar is heavy, I'm not reasoning badly if I conclude that a pallet of the'se bars will be heavy, too.Sometimes combining good things might produce something bad, like topping a pizza with hot fudge sauce. Often, though, a collection of valuable items will also be valuable. It depends on the natures of the items, their value,and the collection.Mill reasons that if every person's ' happiness ' is valuable then a world that contains more ' happiness ' is better than one that contains less, other things equal. That's not obviously fallacious. 2.3. Third Step In the third step, Mill argues that ' happiness ' is the only thing we desire for it'self. This means that it's the only thing for whose desirability in it'selfwe have evidence.Someone might challenge Mill by saying that other things are valuable in themselves. On the surface, Mill's strategy is to agree that people do desire things which, in common language, are … distinguished from ' happiness '[10] for their own sake s. His chief example is being virtuous. However, he asserts,people only desire virtue for it's own sake if they have incorporated it into their ' happiness '. If virtue partially constitutes someone's ' happiness ', then they desire it as a part of their ' happiness '.” Hence there is in reality nothing desired except ' happiness '.”[11]But now Mill may appear inconsistent. He defines '' happiness '' as pleasure, and the absence of pain.”[12] How then, some of his critics have challenged, can virtue be part of our ' happiness '? Virtue ≠ pleasure.[13]The key may be in Mill's account of how something like virtue can become part of our ' happiness '. He explains how the experience of being treated better by others when we behave virtuously can cause us to form a mental association between virtue and pleasure. When people associate virtue with pleasure then the awareness or consciousness that they're virtuous becomes pleasurable forthem.It might then be this pleasure not virtue it'self, strictly speaking that they desire as an end. If this is his intention, then contrary to surface appearances Mill's really denying that some people desire to be virtuous forit's own sake. But he's explaining why they seem to: for them, the connection between virtue and pleasure has become much closer than it is for people who only want to be virtuous so they'll be treated better.[14]Reading Mill this way still lets us say that he takes ' happiness ' to be the only thing we desire for it'self, albeit at the cost of not taking his talk aboutvirtue's becoming part of our ' happiness ' or our desiring it as an end entirely literally. 3. Conclusion Perhaps, then, Mill's proof doesn't contain clumsy mistakes. At least Mill has some responses available to the critics who allege that it does. More work would be needed to judge whether the argument ultimately succeeds, and more work still to get from this principle to utilitarian morality, but Mill'scontribution shouldn't be hastily dismissed.[15]",3 September 2019,Dale E.

Miller  Category: Ethics, Historical Philosophy  Word count: 994 One important question in ethics is what makes people's lives go well for them. Philosophers have proposed various theori es about what things in and of themselves make people better off, i.e., theori es of “well being.”Many such theori es say that pleasurable experi ences are at least part of what makes our lives go well. But do some types of pleasure contribute more to our well being than others The 19 th century philosopher John Stuart Mill (1806 73) answers “yes.” This discussion explains why.![John StuartMill](https://1000wordphilosophy.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/john-stuart-mill-small.jpg?w=656)John Stuart Mill 1. Mill's Hedonism Mill contends that pleasure is not merely one thing that contributes to our well being, it's the only thing. Similarly, only pain makes us worse off. Mill thinks that a person's life goes well for her just insofar as she is happy.Mill defines happiness as pleasure and freedom from pain. In his Utilitarianism , he describes the best life as an existence exempt as far as possible from pain, and as rich as possible in enjoyments.”[1] This theory of well being is called “hedonism.”[2]Mill's case for hedonism comes in Ch. 4 of Utilitarianism , in his so called proof of the principle of utility.”[3] There he contends that the sole evidence … that anything is desirable, is that people do actually desireit.”[4] Because pleasure is the only thing that we desire for it's own sake,Mill argues, we can know that it's uniquely valuable. 2. Bentham and Pushpin An earli er utilitarian philosopher, Jeremy Bentham (1748 1832), also subscribes to hedonism.[5] However, his hedonism differs significantly fromMill's.For Bentham, how much a pleasurable experi ence adds to our happiness is strictly a matter of how much pleasure it contains. This in turn depends on the intensity of the pleasure and how long it lasts. So two factors,intensity and duration , determine a pleasurable experi ence's value.Bentham sees the source of pleasure as irrelevant to it's value. He compares reading poetry with playing the mindless game “push-pin.”[6] As Mill'summarizes Bentham's conclusion, quantity of pleasure being equal, push pin is as good as poetry.”[7] 3. Qualitative Hedonism: A Plurality of Pleasures While Bentham may beli eve that pleasure is a single feeling that's present in all pleasurable experi ences. In contrast, Mill beli eves that there are distinct vari eti es of pleasures; a person may enjoy both reading poetry and running, but the pleasures these activiti es yi eld can have entirely different“feels.”It's therefore possible that some “ kinds of pleasure are more desirable and more valuable than others.”[8] Mill beli eves that some are; certain qualitatively superior pleasures add more to our happiness than an equal or even greater quantity of others. For Mill, therefore, the value of a pleasurable experi ence depends on three factors: intensity, duration, and(unlike Bentham) quality. 4. The Competent Judges Test How do we compare the quality of pleasures Mill says that we must consult people who have enjoyed both. Only they are competent to make this comparison.If they unequivocally desire one more strongly, then it's of higher quality:Of two pleasures, if there be one to which all or almost all who haveexperi ence of both give a decided preference, irrespective of any feeling of moral obligation to prefer it, that is the more desirable pleasure.[9]Note the continuity with Mill's proof: the sole evidence that one pleasure is more desirable is that people do actually desire it more strongly.Mill beli eves that the results of this test are apparent. While virtually everyone has experi ences of bodily pleasures that we share with animals, only some people are suffici ently mentally cultivated to enjoy the distinctly human pleasures of the intellect, of the feelings and imagination, and of the moral sentiments to any extent.[10] Those who are, he claims, decidedly preferthem:Now it is an unquestionable fact that those who are equally acquainted with,and equally capable of appreciating and enjoying, both, do give a most marked preference to the manner of existence which employs their higherfaculti es.[11]This lets Mill answer the objection that hedonists would approve of a person'sliving a life worthy only of swine,” as long as she enjoyed it.[12] His qualitative hedonism can explain why, although such a life would have some value (since lower quality pleasures have some value), she'd be far happi erand much better off were her life rich in higher quality pleasures.[13]One practical upshot of Mill's vi ew is the importance of providing an education suffici ent for enjoying higher quality pleasures to everyone. People lacking such preparation may not appreciate why these pleasures are superior,but they're not competent judges:It is better to be a human being dissatisfi ed than a pig satisfi ed; better tobe Socrates dissatisfi ed than a fool satisfi ed. And if the fool, or the pig,are a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of thequestion.[14] 5. Unanswered questions Some important questions about Mill's vi ews do not receive clear answers. One is whether there are qualitative differences between pains. The other is just how much more valuable than bodily pleasures higher quality pleasures are.Clearly he considers them significantly more valuable; controversially, some scholars beli eve that he considers them infinitely more valuable.[15] 6. Conclusion: Is Mill's Qualitative Hedonism Plausible Mill may seem to underrate the value of bodily pleasures. His vi ew could seem to entail that we should all spend as much time as possible on “rarifi ed”activiti es like museum visit's and opera, and none on exciting pursuit's like sports or sex.However, people with developed faculti es can find higher quality pleasure in diverse activiti es and combined with other pleasures. Someone who knows football well may derive intellectual and aesthetic pleasure from it, along with less refined pleasure in the collisions. Sex can be both emotionally fulfilling and physically pleasurable. Mill suggests that the best lives combine tranquility and excitement.[16]It also bears mentioning that Mill had a somewhat unusual life, starting with a childhood that involved little if any play. So he may not have been entirely competent to judge some bodily pleasures himself.[17]",26 September 2020,Dale E. Miller

M. Trujillo, Jr.  Cate gory: Ethics  Word count: 999 Suppose that you have an ethical problem in medicine or science. How would you solve it Some ethic is ts appeal to an ethical theory , a general explanation of when and why actions are wrong or not.[1] For example, Kant ian s argue that you should treat all people with dignity and act only on rules that everyone can endorse. Consequential is ts argue that you should pick whatever action produces the most good effects for those involved (or avoids the most bad). Virtueethic is ts argue that actions must help people form better characters or live better lives. And care ethic is ts argue that we should foremost consider our feelings and the relationships we share.But there are deep disagreements among advocates of these differing ethical theories. And these disagreements sometimes lead to stalemates in ethical decision making. To try to address this impasse, Tom Beauchamp and James Childress developed a new approach to ethical decision making in their 1977 book, Principles of Biomedical Ethics.[2] They developed a set of principles that most ethic is ts can agree to, an approach named princip lis m. They hoped these core principles would be detailed enough to guide analyses and decisions, yet flexible enough to adapt to different cases and cultures.[3]Their book, now in its eighth edition, helped organize the field of medical ethics and remains a standard text. They defend four principles as central to medical ethics: respect for autonomy , non male fic en ce , beneficence ,and justice.[4] Here I explain each principle using examples from contemporary medical practice.[5]![“Principles of Biomedical Ethics by Tom Beauchamp and James Childress](https://1000wordphilosophy.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/beauchampchildressprinciplies2.png?w=656)“Principlesof Biomedical Ethics by Tom Beauchamp and James Childress 1. Respect for Autonomy Respect for autonomy centers on respecting persons' capacities to make decisions for themselves.[6] In clinical settings, physicians typically evaluate patient's' decision making capacities by checking whether patient's can understand the diagnosis and available treatment options, appreciate the risks and benefits of treatments, and offer reasons for their decisions.[7]Competent adults are generally assumed to be able to decide what to do with their own healthcare, so long as medical professionals explain the diagnosis and treatment options in ways patient's understand.But autonomy comes in de grees. So, even though children do not have capacity to approve complicated, invasive procedures, they can choose their lunch or TVchannel.[8]However, patient's' capacities to make decisions can be impaired, for example by sedation or falling unconscious. To respect patient autonomy in these circumstances, practitioners should encourage advance directives, living wills, and clear conversations with loved ones about quality of life and what should happen if the patient needs resuscitation (e.g., CPR) or life support(e.g., breathing and feeding tubes). These documents and conversations enable medical teams and families to respect a patient's autonomy, even when the patient cannot decide at that moment.[9] 2. Non Male fic en ce and Beneficence Non male fic en ce means avoiding harm, and beneficence means doing good.Together, they represent two sides of the same coin, as medicine often sets health as its destination but painful, risky treatments as its path. You may hear medical practitioners say, First, do no harm,” which aligns with non male fic en ce. Or, Cure sometimes, treat often, comfort always,” which lists the good things practitioners do, especially by being human in the alienating,stressful, and d is empowering situations that patient's face.[10] In conversations about non male fic en ce and beneficence, practitioners often balance the harms and benefits of available options.However, non male fic en ce and beneficence sometimes conflict with autonomy. For example, doctors used to be comfortable with paternalism , or overridingpatient's' wishes to do what is good for them. A paternalistic doctor in the 1970 s might not have told a patient about their untreatable, terminal lung cancer to avoid distressing them, non male fic en ce thus overridingautonomy.[11] Today, such paternalism is often condemned.[12]However conflicts between principles still occur. Consider a patient with astrict religious code who refuses simple yet life saving treatments like blood transfusions. Medical practitioners might recommend the transfusion to help the patient survive (beneficence), but they may respect the autonomy of the patient to refuse, even if it leads to death.[13] 3. Justice Justice concerns the distribution of benefits and burdens in society:people should get what is fair. For medical ethics, this means asking who an institution serves, and at what cost to whom.[14] For example, many wealthy countries provide their citizens access to state funded healthcare. They think that providing medicine for citizens is fair, and that easy access to primary care physicians and preventive medicine bring overall costs down and health outcomes up. Some countries choose to redistribute wealth through taxes to contribute toward the flourishing of their citizens, not just those who can afford private insurance or emergency expenses.Systemic issues are complex, involving policy, administrators, andle gislators. Some physicians respond, therefore, that healthcare practitioners cannot address justice at the bedside and should just care for the patient's in front of them. But practitioners can advocate for justice. They can always ask whether a practice, department, or organization can better accommodate marginalized groups or improve access to resources.[15]One contemporary example is offering gender affirming cate gories on paperwork and shifting to specific questions that a practice needs to know (rather than relying on sex or gender based generalities). For example, rather than a colorectal surgeon asking whether patient's are “male,” she could ask for age and whether they have prostates. Specific qualities or questions might be more relevant than gender or sex.[16] Some trans patient's report that bias or stigma prevents them from seeking medical care. As citizens with rights to healthcare, they shoulder unnecessary burdens and lack fair access to medical resources. But providing better training to healthcare teams, reevaluating in take procedures, and considering patient experiences can improve access to community resources. And this is all more just. 4. Conclusion: A Team Effort Respect for autonomy , non male fic en ce , beneficence , and justice work best together: no single principle always takes priority. In situations where principles conflict, Beauchamp and Childress argue that ethic is ts must work to balance the competing demands of the principles with the cases.[17]While this guarantees no particular verdict, Beauchamp and Childress argue that this critical and open dialogue, involving all stakeholders, provides the best chance to resolve ethical problems. Given the influence of their approach, they may very well be right.[18]",16 February 2021,"G. M. Trujillo, Jr."
52,https://1000wordphilosophy.com/2020/02/02/ethical-egoism/,"Selfishness is often considered a vice and selfish action's are often judged tobe wrong. But sometimes we ought to do what's best for ourselves: in a sense,we sometimes should be selfish.The ethical theory known as ethical egoism states that we are always morally required to do what's in our own self interest. The view isn't that we are selfish this is psychological egoism [1]—but that we ought to be.This essay explores ethical egoism and the main arguments for and against it.![Narcissus](https://1000wordphilosophy.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/echo-and-narcissus-copy.jpg?w=656)Narcissus 1. Understanding Egoism Selfish people often have nasty dispositions towards other people, but ethical egoism generally discourages that: such selfishness is rarely to our advantage, especially in the long run. And egoism does not suggest that we never help others: egoist's might be quite generous.Egoism does entail, however, that what makes acting like this right, when it is right, is that it's for our own benefit: it makes us better off. So, if you must help someone else, this is only because doing so would be good for you; and if you should refrain from harming someone that's also only because doing so is for your benefit. 2. Why Egoism 2.1. Individuals Know Themselves Best Some egoist's argue that, since we each know our own wants and needs best,everyone should focus on themselves: people meddling in other people's lives tend to go badly. 2.2. The Unique Value of Your Own Life Also, some claim that egoism uniquely recognizes the value of individuals'lives and goals. Other ethical theories can require altruistic sacrifices of your interests for the sake of other people or abstract standards, whereas egoist's maintain that each person has their own life to live for themselves, not anyone or anything else.[2] 2.3. Egoism's Explanation of Right and Wrong Finally, some egoist's argue that their theory best explains what makes wrong action's wrong and right action's right. Kant ian s say it's whether anyone is used as a mere means; consequential is ts say it's an action's consequences;egoist's say it's really how someone's action's impact their self interest.[3]Let's respond to these arguments by reviewing some objections. 3. Why Not Egoism 3.1. Egoism and What's Good for Everyone First, in response to the claim that egoism is desirable because everyone adopting it would be good for all, we should notice that this isn't an egoistic argument since the motivating concern is everyone's interests,which aren't important if egoism is true: only you should matter to you.And are we really always meddling with people when we help them say by trying to help feed people who are starving to death or are living in dire poverty as some egoist's say we are 3.2. Egoism and Contradictions One objection assumes that ethical theories should help resolve conflicts:e.g., for consequential is ts, who should win a presidential election Whoever will produce the best consequences as president. Egoists, however, say that each candidate should do what's in their best self interest, which is winning the election. But, critics argue, they can't both win, so egoism requires the impossible, so it can't be correct.[4]Egoists might respond that not everyone can do what's right: if you win, you do what's right; if you lose, you've done wrong.They can also use this objection to refine egoism: you must try to do what'sbest for you, not necessarily achieve that. Actual success is often difficult,but everyone can try. 3.3. Egoism and Wronging Others for Your Own Gain Another objection takes us to the heart of the matter. Imagine this:Your credit card bill is due tonight, but you won't be able to pay the full amount until next month, so you will be charged interest and a late fee.You just saw someone, however, accidentally leave their wallet on a park bench with a lot of cash hanging out of it. You saw where they went, but you could take the cash to pay the bill and nobody would ever know.Also, you know of an elderly person who always carries a lot of cash on their evening walk. You know you could rob them, pay your bill, certainly never get caught and then buy dinner at a fancy restaurant.If ethical egoism is true, not only can you permissibly take the wallet and rob someone, you must : not doing so would be wrong, since these crimes are in your self interest. (If you'd feel guilty doing this, egoist's respond that you shouldn't since you've done nothing wrong on their view.)Many believe that, since action's like these are clearly wrong, this shows that egoism is false and the argument at 2.3 fails: egoism does not best explain our moral obligations even if we sometimes must do what's best forourselves.An egoist might respond that we are just assuming their theory is false:they don't agree that we shouldn't steal the wallet and refrain fromassault.[5]But we aren't assuming anything: we just have better reason to believe that assault for personal gain is wrong than that egoism is true. Recall that racists and sexists do not agree that their forms of discrimination are wrong either, but this doesn't justify racism or sexism. People sometimes hold false moral views; this might be true of egoist's. 3.4. Egoism and Discrimination Finally, racists and sexists think that people of their group are entitled to special benefit's and are even justified in harming people not of their group.Egoists think something similar, but about themselves : harms they allow for and inflict on other people just don't matter.But is there anything about one's race or sex or one'self that justifies treating others badly No, so egoism is a form of prejudice, in favor of your own group of one, you.[6] This objection agrees with the argument at 2.2,that everyone does have their own life, but corrects it with the fact thateveryone's life matters, not just the egoist's. 4. Conclusion Doing what's right is sometimes in our self interest. If the above discussion is correct, though, that an action benefit's us is never the sole reason it is right. And, more importantly, if an action is not in our ownself interest, we might be obligated to do it, nevertheless.[7]There are other arguments about egoism. Reviewing them might be in our self interest. Should we",2 February 2020,No author

Or suppose the male members of a board reject a female colleague's suggestions because they believe that women are too often irrational. Imagine also a woman whose postpartum depression is dismissed by her doctor as mere '' baby blues.'[1]All three people above suffer what contemporary English philosopher Miranda F ricker calls epistemic injustice.[2] Epistemic means relating to knowledge. Epistemic injustice refers to a wrong done to someone as a knower or transmitter of knowledge: due to unjustified prejudice, someone is unfairly judged to not have the knowledge or reasonable beliefs that they actuallyhave.F ricker identifies two forms of epistemic injustice: testimonial and her men e utica l. This essay explains these forms of epistemic injustice and surveys some suggestions for how to prevent them.![Miranda F ricker, ""EpistemicInjustice""](https://1000wordphilosophy.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/epistemic-injustice-miranda-fricker3.jpg?w=656)Miranda F ricker, ""Epistemic Injustice"" 1. Testimonial Injustice Testimony involves someone sharing their knowledge with someone else.Testimony typically happens when people communicate: e.g., giving directions,reporting the news, writing a research paper. Testimony isn't just statements in a courtroom: whenever we gain knowledge from other people, we rely on testimony. Testimony is credible when there's good reason to believe thatwhat's claimed is true, when the person testifying knows what they claim toknow.[3]A speaker suffers testimonial injustice when their testimony is judged to be not or less credible because of prejudice and not because the testimony it'self is unreasonable.[4] These prejudices can be related to race, gender,accent, age, and others and impact people in many areas of life: economic,educational, professional, sexual, le gal, political, religious, and more.Testimonial injustices caused by such prejudices constitute the central cases of testimonial injustice.Testimonial injustice can take various forms. For instance, a female boardmember's prediction might be rejected due to the prejudices of her malecolleague's: this is called testimonial quieting. Alternatively, that female board member might instead silence or limit her assertions beforehand knowing that she'll receive in appropriately low credibility: this is called testimonial smothering.[5] 2. Her men e utica l Injustice A second type of epistemic injustice is known as hermeneutical injustice.“Her men e utica l” relates to interpretation and understanding.Consider sexual harassment. Although this might be surprising, that concepthasn't always existed. So imagine a woman who is sexually harassed at her workplace before the introduction of the concept in the 1970s.[6] She lives in a society where unwanted sexual propositions are typically seen as a form of'flirting,' and rejection of them as a '' lack of a sense of humor.' Since she' lacks the concept of sexual harassment, she'll have difficulty understanding her experience adequately or finding the appropriate words to communicate it to others.Her men e utica l injustice then is about cases of ' lacking the concepts to adequately understand or communicate an experience. Her men e utica l injustice occurs when this failure is due ultimately to prejudices that result in people' lacking the concepts needed to understand or communicate their experiences.[7]The injustice above was due to women's (partial) exclusion from certainprofessions—e.g., journalism, politics, academics, law which tended to result in biased interpretations of women's experiences, as in interpreting sexual harassment as merely a form of flirting.Some argue that hermeneutical injustice doesn't require a ' lack of concepts since it can occur when interpretations of a certain group's experiences, and the result ing concepts, are unduly dismissed by others. For instance,postpartum depression might be dismissed as a personal deficiency rather thana genuine medical condition: this is called hermeneutical dissent.[8]Unlike testimonial injustice, hermeneutical injustice is not the result of an individual hearer's prejudice: no single agent perpetrates hermeneuticalinjustice.[9] In the sexual harassment example, it's not any individual'sprejudice, but prejudicial practices in society that resulted in people' lacking the concept of sexual harassment. 3. The Wrong of Epistemic Injustice Producing and spreading knowledge is part of being human. Epistemic injustice results in victim's' being at least partially excluded from participation in these activities.Epistemic injustice can lead to grave practical consequences for both victim's and wrongdoers. A wrongly disbelieved defendant might lose their freedom or life. Not listening to a board member who might have crucial knowledge for the future of the company may have dire consequences.Epistemic injustice also harms the victim's identity. We typically define ourselves partly by our group identities: racial, sexual, religious,political, and more. We construct this part of our identity largely by communicating with others or using the available conceptual resources. So,being considered untrustworthy or ' lacking the conceptual resources to make sense of our experiences potentially prevents us from constructing our own social identity from becoming who we are. If a woman who is interested in and has a talent for politics is constantly excluded from political dialogue, she can hardly fulfill her potential to become a politician.[10] 4. How to Prevent Epistemic Injustice To prevent epistemic injustice, F ricker suggests that we cultivate reliable character trait's—virtues—that neutralize prejudice.[11]We should aim to be aware of the potential prejudice in who we judge as credible. If we find that the low credibility we assigned to a speaker is due to prejudice, we should work to change that attitude.[12]Since victim's of prejudice can have undue difficulty articulating their experiences, we should try to make out how their experiences would be understood in a prejudice free climate.Some argue that individual efforts, though they should prove useful, may not be enough to defeat epistemic injustice. For instance, education is a marker of credibility. But the ' lack of proper education might be due to the absence of fair opportunities for education. So, some people are unfairly considered not credible and excluded from participation in knowledge related activities because of underlying injustice in social institutions. The solution then requires changes in social institutions, not just individual efforts.[13] 5. ConclusionIt's difficult to overestimate the value of being (recognized as) someone with knowledge. So it's difficult to overestimate the badness of knowledge relatedunfairness or epistemic injustice. Addressing and avoiding such injustice,however, requires both social and political change and, often, serious personal effort.",21 July 2020,"Huzeyfe Demirtas Categories: Epistemology, Ethics, Social and Political Philosophy, Philosophy of Sex and Gender, Philosophy of Race, Logic and Reasoning Wordcount: 996 Suppose a jury rejec…"" />

Nasty divorce Hire a good lawyer. In short, if you've got a hard question or problem, you should seek the guidance of an expert.Experts don't just guide personal choices: they shape social policy, law and collective decision making: how should scientific research be interpreted What unintended consequences might result from this policy Is this proposed law le gally viable Experts help answer hard questions like these.But what is an expert How can we tell if someone is an expert And, since experts are important, why do people often reject their advice?![expertise](https://1000wordphilosophy.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/expertise.jpe g?w=656&h=557) 1. What is expertise There are many types of experts. Some experts – e.g., physicists, art historians, accountants – have exceptional knowledge. Others – e.g., chessmaster s, professional violinists, surgeons – have exceptional abilities. Some expertise relates less to doing and more to perceiving : e.g., an expert distiller can taste the nuances in whiskey; an expert radiologist can read an X ray efficiently.[1]Despite these differences, all experts have a high de gree of competence in a specific domain (or subject area) that makes them an authority in thatdomain.[2]Becoming an expert typically requires thousands of hours of focused study and practice.[3] Other experts usually review this practice and give feedback,leading to more practice.[4] Because expertise develops over time, someone can be more or less of an expert.[5] Expertise requires continual study and practice or else it can be lost.Experts are not simply reservoirs of information; they have a deep understanding of their domain, usually including how and why it's claims areaccepted.[6] They are not dabblers or merely we'll informed: they areauthorities.The authority of an expert is epistemic : their knowledge and understanding gives us good reason to trust them in matters of their domain of expertise.[7]Our beliefs are more likely to be justified or true if we get them fromexperts.[8] Experts, then, make us better off, by sharing their knowledge or using their skills. 2. How can we tell whether someone is an expertSometimes it's clear that someone is an expert: the proof is in their performance, e.g., gold medal winners, trial winning attorneys. Other times,it's harder to tell.There are, however, some general indicators that someone is likely an expert. Experts usually:   have extensive specialized education and experience;   have a track record of being right or helpful;   have high professional standing or credentials;   have marks of professional achievement, such as publications or awards;   can speak easily and confidently about their domain.[9]These indicators aren't perfect. Some de gree programs, credentials and awardsdon't amount to much. Some fields don't have track records, or they aren'tavailable. Some experts tend to lose skill with greater experience.[10] Some we'll meaning people claim to be among the experts in a domain, and even have credentials and experience, but they simply are not experts: they slipped through the cracks, so to speak. Some people claim expertise in areas where there is no genuine expertise: if there is no knowledge or we'll justified belief in a domain (as opposed to mere beliefs or opinions), then there are no experts in that domain. And there are charlatans, people who, for a variety of reasons, present themselves as experts, even though they are not experts and they know it.Identifying who and who is not an expert is sometimes challenging. But it'snot impossible or not worth trying. And, again, sometimes it's clear who the experts are. 3. Skepticism About Experts People who haven't had the education, training, or practice of an expert are far less likely to be as skilled or knowledgeable in that domain, compared to an expert. So, expert guidance is more likely to be correct or useful than our own: this is why experts matter.[11]Some people, however, are skeptical of experts and even the whole idea ofexpertise.[12] Here are some reasons why:A. Expert opinion sometimes changes:We all know of cases where it seems like the experts got it wrong: butter was bad for you, now it's fine; all women should get mammograms, now it's only women over 50; one doctor told you X, but another said Y. Ever changing expert opinion sometimes leads people to doubt experts in general.B. Experts sometimes overreach:Experts sometimes overstep their bounds. They make claims about subjects outside their expertise, e.g., physicians offering political commentary. When experts present themselves as authorities in areas outside of their expertise,it is harder to know who the genuine experts are and it's easier to lose respect for experts.C. Experts sometimes disagree:Even genuine experts – people with equally strong training and experience sometimes disagree. TV courtroom dramas make much of this: You bring your experts; we'll bring ours.” If we can't decide which expert is more likely correct, we might lose confidence in experts generally.D. We sometimes resist expert authority:Experts sometimes tell us things we just don't want to hear, and so we refuse to listen. We are so confident that we are right that we dismiss anyone who contradicts us, including experts.[13] Sometimes this is because a belief is so important to us that we are offended by the idea that others know more about it than we do. When we claim expertise that we really don't have, this is often at our own peril.Recognizing why people sometimes reject expertise can make us more critical of that rejection. Sometimes skepticism about experts is justified. But, more often, experts are in better positions than us in knowing what we should think or do, and so skepticism is unwise. 4. Conclusion Studying expertise helps us better identify experts and understand why they are important.Many questions remain, however, e.g.: what should we believe, and do, when experts disagree?[14] Could recognizing the value of expertise discourage democracy, which allows non experts '' opinions to influence important decisions and policies?[15] Are there experts on controversial topics, like ethics or justice or politics?[16] Finally, are these all just questions for experts, or should everyone try to answer them as best they can",25 October 2018,Jamie Carlin Watson

67,https://1000wordphilosophy.com/2015/11/05/ethical-realism/,"1. Introduction'Happiness is good.' '' We shouldn't punish innocents.' '' Generosity is a goodcharacter-trait.'1Ethical realists say that ethical claims such as these are objectively true : their truth does not depend on anyone's particular opinions, beliefs,preferences, or characteristics. That is, realists believe that there are right answers in ethics.They reject relativism , according to which there are only non objective ethical facts, and they reject nihilism , according to which there are no ethical facts (a theory sometimes called '' error theory'),2 and maybe even no ethical assertions of any kind (a theory sometimes called 'non-cognitivism').3Here, I first lay out several reasons in favor of ethical realism and then respond to several famous criticisms of the position.![Honhorst - TheConcert](https://1000wordphilosophy.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/honthorstlg.jpg?w=656) 2. In Favor of Ethical Realism Ethical realism was more or less taken for granted throughout most of the history of philosophy.4 Today, most experts agree that it's true.5 Consider three types of argument for realism. A. Common Sense or Intuition It seems to lots of us as if suffering is bad ; the claim is obvious,plausible, common sens ical, and self-evident.6 Arguably, everyone at least tacitly considers appearances to be evidence.7 Similarly, it seems as if stealing is wrong, even if ' ' you like to steal, and even if ' ' you trick someone into believing that stealing isn't wrong. So there's plenty of intuitive evidence that these ethical truths are objective: their truth doesn't vary based on any particular person's situation or preferences. B. Ethical Norm at iv it y and Epistemic Norm at iv it yIf ' ' you think that moral facts are suspect in some way, then ' ' you might have to worry that facts about evidence are suspect for analogous reasons. There's a similarity between moral claims, about what we ought to do from the perspective of morality, and epistemological claims, about what we ought to do from the perspective of knowledge and evidence.8 Both seem normative :they're telling us that some course of action or belief is the correct one,or better than others, or that there is good evidence for something.Therefore, arguments that target norm at iv it y in general may undermine themselves. They may apply just as well, or better, to the idea that some or theories are simply more objectively rational or justified or supported by the evidence than other theories.9 And so if ' ' you reject norm at iv it y, ' ' you'rerejecting the idea that ' ' your own position is justified. C. In d is pens ability Arguably, much of our discourse is committed to the existence of genuinely normative properties and facts. Compare the case of mathematics, which might be a discourse about abstract objects that don't clearly have any direct causal contact with people's minds. Mathematicians continue to make progress and devise theories that can be applied to many particular projects. Maybe mathematicians are talking about nonexistent objects numbers and somehow,coincidentally, all this talk has paid off. But maybe mathematics is so successful because it's making true statements about numbers. Similarly,much of our discourse seems to assume the existence of ethical truths, and maybe the best explanation for this fact is that some of these truths reallyexist.10 3. Defending Realism Ethical realism inspires many counter arguments. ' We have space to surveythree.11 Throughout, we should continually consider a general reply that Moore an 12 realists have offered: that any argument against ethical realism, in order to justify us in rejecting the claim (e.g.) '' ' you shouldn't kill every living thing in the world, even if ' ' you want to,' will have to be such that all of it's premises have more overall evidence than '' ' you shouldn't kill everyone in the world, even if ' ' you want to.' One might offer this Moore Bam brough Huemer style 13 response to each of the three anti realist arguments,but I'll also gesture at other objections. A. Strangeness'Ethical properties would be strange.'14 Objections: It's not clear what strangeness is, why it should matter (given how many other things arestrange),15 nor why ethical properties would be strange; indeed, goodness and badness seem normal and familiar. B. Disagreement'There's too much disagreement about ethics for there to be facts about it.'16Objections: Many apparen'tly ethical disagreements are merely descriptive disagreements in disguise;17 just because people disagree about something,that doesn't normally mean there's no fact of the matter (compare the disagreement about whether Earth is the center of the Solar System)18; and such arguments run the risk of generalizing too far.19 C. Evolutionary Debunking'Our ethical intuitions are the product of evolution, and are therefore apriori unlikely to produce true beliefs.'20 Objections: If commonsense morality is true, then we should expect a reliable faculty of moral knowledge to be adaptive ; thus the debunker at least can't assume that accurate moral beliefs are non-adaptive.21 In addition, if moral truths are known throughreason,22 then it's to be expected that we would have the ability to learn these truths, even if it wasn't adaptive; compare calculus, which didn't help our ancestors survive. This argument, like others, may also prove too much.23 D. A Note on Epistemic Justification As noted, all three of these objections can also be seen to inspire arguments targeting epistemic justification in general,24 with the consequence that the objector must admit that her position is no more justified than it's denial.And as the Moore an will argue, if, for each anti realist argument, we are more justified in affirming '' You shouldn't kill everyone in the world, even if ' ' you want to,' then we are arguably justified in putting more confidence inethical realism than in nihilism. 4. Conclusion: Naturalism and Non Naturalism Even if we agree with most historical and contemporary philosophers that ethical realism is true, we face one more very important question: Are these truths natural, physical, or merely descriptive facts, such as facts about pleasure or survival  Naturalists say '' yes '.' Or are these truths (instead)irreducibly, inherently normative Non naturalist or robust realists take this option.This is a complicated topic and an area of a great deal of contemporaryresearch.25 For now, simply note that most naturalists concede that ethical facts aren't conceptually definable as descriptive facts, but add that these facts are nevertheless identical to descriptive facts, perhaps like how water is H 2 O, even though people once knew about water without defining it as H 2 O.26This form of naturalism ontological or synthetic naturalismis the most popular form today.27 But both naturalists and non naturalists are, once again, realists: they hold that there are right answers in ethics.",5 November 2015,No author

E. Moore (in)famously purported to refute external world skepticism with what's known as Moore's Proof : he held out his hands during a lecture and said Here is one hand and here is another, claiming to prove that there is an external world on that basis.[2]While philosophers tend not to think that Moore's Proof refutes skepticism, it is hard to explain why.[3] This essay reviews some of the most importantattempts.![G.E. Moore's ""Proof of an ExternalWorld.""](https://1000wordphilosophy.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/moore.jpg?w=656&h=463)G.E.Moore's ""Proof of an External World."" 1. Transmission Failure To begin evaluating Moore's Proof, let's consider a potentially analogousproof:I'magine Sally and Susie are at an art exhibition viewing a wall that appears red. Sally asks, What color is the wall Susie replies, Well, the wall looks red.” Sally counters with, But couldn't the wall be white with hidden red lights shining on it Susie answers: The wall looks red, and so it is red. Therefore, it's not white with hidden red lights shining on it.”Did Susie prove that there are no hidden red lights shining on the wall Intuitively not. But why Some philosophers have argued that the reason why responses like Susie's fail is because it's a case of what's known as transmission failure.” This occurs when someone's belief A entails belief B (B is a logical consequence of A),but their support for A is not support for B, because prior support for B is necessary for getting support for A.On this view, the reason why Susie didn't prove that there are no hidden red lights is that, by relying on her perceptions to believe that the wall is red,she is presupposing that there are no such lights.Some philosophers think that Moore's proof is also a case of transmissionfailure.[4] Moore believes that he has hands, and this entails that there's an external world. But, intuitively, his perceptions could support his belief that he has hands only if he already has support for thinking there is an external world. For aren't hands external objects?[5] 2. Liberalism and Conservatism Howe'ver, some philosophers argue that Moore's Proof is not a case of transmission failure. On their view, we don't need evidence for his conclusion in order to have perceptual evidence for his premise. Instead, we only need to lack evidence against the conclusion in order for our perception as of our hands to support the premise that we have hands.[6] This is called liberalism about perceptual justification:Liberalism : For your perception to provide evidence for your external world beliefs, you must lack evidence for skeptical hypotheses.In contrast, proponents of transmission failure seem committed to:Conservatism : For your perception to provide evidence for your external world beliefs, you must already have evidence to reject skepticalhypotheses.[7]The trouble is that conservatism seems to imply skepticism.[8] How could you get evidence against skeptical hypotheses if not by relying on your perception? This supports taking a closer look at liberalism. 3. Dogmatism One way of developing liberalism is dogmatism. According to dogmatism, if your perception as of something's being the case (call it P) makes it seem to you that P, then provided that you lack sufficient evidence to doubt that P, you are justified in believing that P.[9]For example, right now your perceptions make it seem to you that you are reading an essay. Now consider whether you have evidence to believe that you are not reading an essay. (Do you). Provided you lack such evidence,dogmatism implies that you are justified in believing that you are reading anessay.The dogmatist extends this idea to Moore's Proof as follows:It seems to you that you have hands. You also lack evidence to believe that there is no external world. So, your perception justifies you in believing that you have hands. So, you are justified in believing in an external world.Dogmatism by it'self, howe'ver, doesn't resolve our puzzle about why Moore's'proof' is unsatisfying. If I'm a skeptic and you rehearsed Moore's Proof forme, I probably wouldn't be persuaded. But why not After all, according to dogmatism, I apparen'tly have justification to believe the conclusion! That'swhat we'll explore next. 4. Why is Moore's Proof Un persuasive Dogmatists argue that Moore's Proof might not persuade the external world skeptic but that this doesn't make it a bad argument. This is because there is a difference between arguments which give us justification to believe their conclusions justifying arguments and arguments which persuade people who doubt the conclusion persuasive arguments. An argument with unjustified premises might persuade someone to overcome their doubts about the conclusion. Likewise, an argument with justified premises might fail to persuade someone to believe a conclusion they have justification tobelieve.[10]The skeptic doubts that there is an external world, which undermines her confidence in her perceptions. Moore's Proof won't help her overcome her doubts. This is because her doubts prevent her from accepting the premise ofMoore's Proof (I have hands), even though her perceptions do give her justification to believe that premise.Moore's Proof starts from the assumption that one needn't doubt their perceptions unless there is concrete evidence of unreliability, like bad weather or intoxication. The skeptical hypothesis that everything is a projection of one's mind, howe'ver, is a mere logical possibility; there's no concrete evidence that it might actually be the case. For this reason, it'shouldn't undermine one's trust in their perceptions. 5. Conclusion Most people who first encounter Moore's Proof typically think that it's a total failure. As we've seen, it's not clear why or even whether it is a failure.",23 February 2021,"Chris Ranalli Categories: Epistemology, Metaphysics, Historical Philosophy Word count: 1000 External world skepticism is the view that we cannot know anything about the external world: we c…"" />

Or suppose the male members of a board reject a female colleague's suggestions because they believe that women are too often irrational. Imagine also a woman whose postpartum depression is dismissed by her doctor as mere '' baby blues.'[1]All three people above suffer what contemporary English philosopher Miranda F ricker calls epistemic injustice.[2] Epistemic means relating to knowledge. Epistemic injustice refers to a wrong done to someone as a knower or transmitter of knowledge: due to unjustified prejudice, someone is unfairly judged to not have the knowledge or reasonable beliefs that they actuallyhave.F ricker identifies two forms of epistemic injustice: testimonial and her men e utica l. This essay explains these forms of epistemic injustice and surveys some suggestions for how to prevent them.![Miranda F ricker, ""EpistemicInjustice""](https://1000wordphilosophy.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/epistemic-injustice-miranda-fricker3.jpg?w=656)Miranda F ricker, ""Epistemic Injustice"" 1. Testimonial Injustice Testimony involves someone sharing their knowledge with someone else.Testimony typically happens when people communicate: e.g., giving directions,reporting the news, writing a research paper. Testimony isn't just statements in a courtroom: whenever we gain knowledge from other people, we rely on testimony. Testimony is credible when there's good reason to believe thatwhat's claimed is true, when the person testifying knows what they claim toknow.[3]A speaker suffers testimonial injustice when their testimony is judged to be not or less credible because of prejudice and not because the testimony it'self is unreasonable.[4] These prejudices can be related to race, gender,accent, age, and others and impact people in many areas of life: economic,educational, professional, sexual, le gal, political, religious, and more.Testimonial injustices caused by such prejudices constitute the central cases of testimonial injustice.Testimonial injustice can take various forms. For instance, a female boardmember's prediction might be rejected due to the prejudices of her malecolleague's: this is called testimonial quieting. Alternatively, that female board member might instead silence or limit her assertions beforehand knowing that she'll receive in appropriately low credibility: this is called testimonial smothering.[5] 2. Her men e utica l Injustice A second type of epistemic injustice is known as hermeneutical injustice.“Her men e utica l” relates to interpretation and understanding.Consider sexual harassment. Although this might be surprising, that concepthasn't always existed. So imagine a woman who is sexually harassed at her workplace before the introduction of the concept in the 1970s.[6] She lives in a society where unwanted sexual propositions are typically seen as a form of'flirting,' and rejection of them as a '' lack of a sense of humor.' Since she' lacks the concept of sexual harassment, she'll have difficulty understanding her experience adequately or finding the appropriate words to communicate it to others.Her men e utica l injustice then is about cases of ' lacking the concepts to adequately understand or communicate an experience. Her men e utica l injustice occurs when this failure is due ultimately to prejudices that result in people' lacking the concepts needed to understand or communicate their experiences.[7]The injustice above was due to women's (partial) exclusion from certainprofessions—e.g., journalism, politics, academics, law which tended to result in biased interpretations of women's experiences, as in interpreting sexual harassment as merely a form of flirting.Some argue that hermeneutical injustice doesn't require a ' lack of concepts since it can occur when interpretations of a certain group's experiences, and the result ing concepts, are unduly dismissed by others. For instance,postpartum depression might be dismissed as a personal deficiency rather thana genuine medical condition: this is called hermeneutical dissent.[8]Unlike testimonial injustice, hermeneutical injustice is not the result of an individual hearer's prejudice: no single agent perpetrates hermeneuticalinjustice.[9] In the sexual harassment example, it's not any individual'sprejudice, but prejudicial practices in society that resulted in people' lacking the concept of sexual harassment. 3. The Wrong of Epistemic Injustice Producing and spreading knowledge is part of being human. Epistemic injustice results in victim's' being at least partially excluded from participation in these activities.Epistemic injustice can lead to grave practical consequences for both victim's and wrongdoers. A wrongly disbelieved defendant might lose their freedom or life. Not listening to a board member who might have crucial knowledge for the future of the company may have dire consequences.Epistemic injustice also harms the victim's identity. We typically define ourselves partly by our group identities: racial, sexual, religious,political, and more. We construct this part of our identity largely by communicating with others or using the available conceptual resources. So,being considered untrustworthy or ' lacking the conceptual resources to make sense of our experiences potentially prevents us from constructing our own social identity from becoming who we are. If a woman who is interested in and has a talent for politics is constantly excluded from political dialogue, she can hardly fulfill her potential to become a politician.[10] 4. How to Prevent Epistemic Injustice To prevent epistemic injustice, F ricker suggests that we cultivate reliable character trait's—virtues—that neutralize prejudice.[11]We should aim to be aware of the potential prejudice in who we judge as credible. If we find that the low credibility we assigned to a speaker is due to prejudice, we should work to change that attitude.[12]Since victim's of prejudice can have undue difficulty articulating their experiences, we should try to make out how their experiences would be understood in a prejudice free climate.Some argue that individual efforts, though they should prove useful, may not be enough to defeat epistemic injustice. For instance, education is a marker of credibility. But the ' lack of proper education might be due to the absence of fair opportunities for education. So, some people are unfairly considered not credible and excluded from participation in knowledge related activities because of underlying injustice in social institutions. The solution then requires changes in social institutions, not just individual efforts.[13] 5. ConclusionIt's difficult to overestimate the value of being (recognized as) someone with knowledge. So it's difficult to overestimate the badness of knowledge relatedunfairness or epistemic injustice. Addressing and avoiding such injustice,however, requires both social and political change and, often, serious personal effort.",21 July 2020,"Huzeyfe Demirtas Categories: Epistemology, Ethics, Social and Political Philosophy, Philosophy of Sex and Gender, Philosophy of Race, Logic and Reasoning Wordcount: 996 Suppose a jury rejec…"" />

Or suppose the male members of a board reject a female colleague's suggestions because they believe that women are too often irrational. Imagine also a woman whose postpartum depression is dismissed by her doctor as mere '' baby blues.'[1]All three people above suffer what contemporary English philosopher Miranda F ricker calls epistemic injustice.[2] Epistemic means relating to knowledge. Epistemic injustice refers to a wrong done to someone as a knower or transmitter of knowledge: due to unjustified prejudice, someone is unfairly judged to not have the knowledge or reasonable beliefs that they actuallyhave.F ricker identifies two forms of epistemic injustice: testimonial and her men e utica l. This essay explains these forms of epistemic injustice and surveys some suggestions for how to prevent them.![Miranda F ricker, ""EpistemicInjustice""](https://1000wordphilosophy.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/epistemic-injustice-miranda-fricker3.jpg?w=656)Miranda F ricker, ""Epistemic Injustice"" 1. Testimonial Injustice Testimony involves someone sharing their knowledge with someone else.Testimony typically happens when people communicate: e.g., giving directions,reporting the news, writing a research paper. Testimony isn't just statements in a courtroom: whenever we gain knowledge from other people, we rely on testimony. Testimony is credible when there's good reason to believe thatwhat's claimed is true, when the person testifying knows what they claim toknow.[3]A speaker suffers testimonial injustice when their testimony is judged to be not or less credible because of prejudice and not because the testimony it'self is unreasonable.[4] These prejudices can be related to race, gender,accent, age, and others and impact people in many areas of life: economic,educational, professional, sexual, le gal, political, religious, and more.Testimonial injustices caused by such prejudices constitute the central cases of testimonial injustice.Testimonial injustice can take various forms. For instance, a female boardmember's prediction might be rejected due to the prejudices of her malecolleague's: this is called testimonial quieting. Alternatively, that female board member might instead silence or limit her assertions beforehand knowing that she'll receive in appropriately low credibility: this is called testimonial smothering.[5] 2. Her men e utica l Injustice A second type of epistemic injustice is known as hermeneutical injustice.“Her men e utica l” relates to interpretation and understanding.Consider sexual harassment. Although this might be surprising, that concepthasn't always existed. So imagine a woman who is sexually harassed at her workplace before the introduction of the concept in the 1970s.[6] She lives in a society where unwanted sexual propositions are typically seen as a form of'flirting,' and rejection of them as a '' lack of a sense of humor.' Since she' lacks the concept of sexual harassment, she'll have difficulty understanding her experience adequately or finding the appropriate words to communicate it to others.Her men e utica l injustice then is about cases of ' lacking the concepts to adequately understand or communicate an experience. Her men e utica l injustice occurs when this failure is due ultimately to prejudices that result in people' lacking the concepts needed to understand or communicate their experiences.[7]The injustice above was due to women's (partial) exclusion from certainprofessions—e.g., journalism, politics, academics, law which tended to result in biased interpretations of women's experiences, as in interpreting sexual harassment as merely a form of flirting.Some argue that hermeneutical injustice doesn't require a ' lack of concepts since it can occur when interpretations of a certain group's experiences, and the result ing concepts, are unduly dismissed by others. For instance,postpartum depression might be dismissed as a personal deficiency rather thana genuine medical condition: this is called hermeneutical dissent.[8]Unlike testimonial injustice, hermeneutical injustice is not the result of an individual hearer's prejudice: no single agent perpetrates hermeneuticalinjustice.[9] In the sexual harassment example, it's not any individual'sprejudice, but prejudicial practices in society that resulted in people' lacking the concept of sexual harassment. 3. The Wrong of Epistemic Injustice Producing and spreading knowledge is part of being human. Epistemic injustice results in victim's' being at least partially excluded from participation in these activities.Epistemic injustice can lead to grave practical consequences for both victim's and wrongdoers. A wrongly disbelieved defendant might lose their freedom or life. Not listening to a board member who might have crucial knowledge for the future of the company may have dire consequences.Epistemic injustice also harms the victim's identity. We typically define ourselves partly by our group identities: racial, sexual, religious,political, and more. We construct this part of our identity largely by communicating with others or using the available conceptual resources. So,being considered untrustworthy or ' lacking the conceptual resources to make sense of our experiences potentially prevents us from constructing our own social identity from becoming who we are. If a woman who is interested in and has a talent for politics is constantly excluded from political dialogue, she can hardly fulfill her potential to become a politician.[10] 4. How to Prevent Epistemic Injustice To prevent epistemic injustice, F ricker suggests that we cultivate reliable character trait's—virtues—that neutralize prejudice.[11]We should aim to be aware of the potential prejudice in who we judge as credible. If we find that the low credibility we assigned to a speaker is due to prejudice, we should work to change that attitude.[12]Since victim's of prejudice can have undue difficulty articulating their experiences, we should try to make out how their experiences would be understood in a prejudice free climate.Some argue that individual efforts, though they should prove useful, may not be enough to defeat epistemic injustice. For instance, education is a marker of credibility. But the ' lack of proper education might be due to the absence of fair opportunities for education. So, some people are unfairly considered not credible and excluded from participation in knowledge related activities because of underlying injustice in social institutions. The solution then requires changes in social institutions, not just individual efforts.[13] 5. ConclusionIt's difficult to overestimate the value of being (recognized as) someone with knowledge. So it's difficult to overestimate the badness of knowledge relatedunfairness or epistemic injustice. Addressing and avoiding such injustice,however, requires both social and political change and, often, serious personal effort.",21 July 2020,"Huzeyfe Demirtas Categories: Epistemology, Ethics, Social and Political Philosophy, Philosophy of Sex and Gender, Philosophy of Race, Logic and Reasoning Wordcount: 996 Suppose a jury rejec…"" />

Nasty divorce Hire a good lawyer. In short, if you've got a hard question or problem, you should seek the guidance of an expert.Experts don't just guide personal choices: they shape social policy, law and collective decision making: how should scientific research be interpreted What unintended consequences might result from this policy Is this proposed law le gally viable Experts help answer hard questions like these.But what is an expert How can we tell if someone is an expert And, since experts are important, why do people often reject their advice?![expertise](https://1000wordphilosophy.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/expertise.jpe g?w=656&h=557) 1. What is expertise There are many types of experts. Some experts – e.g., physicists, art historians, accountants – have exceptional knowledge. Others – e.g., chessmaster s, professional violinists, surgeons – have exceptional abilities. Some expertise relates less to doing and more to perceiving : e.g., an expert distiller can taste the nuances in whiskey; an expert radiologist can read an X ray efficiently.[1]Despite these differences, all experts have a high de gree of competence in a specific domain (or subject area) that makes them an authority in thatdomain.[2]Becoming an expert typically requires thousands of hours of focused study and practice.[3] Other experts usually review this practice and give feedback,leading to more practice.[4] Because expertise develops over time, someone can be more or less of an expert.[5] Expertise requires continual study and practice or else it can be lost.Experts are not simply reservoirs of information; they have a deep understanding of their domain, usually including how and why it's claims areaccepted.[6] They are not dabblers or merely we'll informed: they areauthorities.The authority of an expert is epistemic : their knowledge and understanding gives us good reason to trust them in matters of their domain of expertise.[7]Our beliefs are more likely to be justified or true if we get them fromexperts.[8] Experts, then, make us better off, by sharing their knowledge or using their skills. 2. How can we tell whether someone is an expertSometimes it's clear that someone is an expert: the proof is in their performance, e.g., gold medal winners, trial winning attorneys. Other times,it's harder to tell.There are, however, some general indicators that someone is likely an expert. Experts usually:   have extensive specialized education and experience;   have a track record of being right or helpful;   have high professional standing or credentials;   have marks of professional achievement, such as publications or awards;   can speak easily and confidently about their domain.[9]These indicators aren't perfect. Some de gree programs, credentials and awardsdon't amount to much. Some fields don't have track records, or they aren'tavailable. Some experts tend to lose skill with greater experience.[10] Some we'll meaning people claim to be among the experts in a domain, and even have credentials and experience, but they simply are not experts: they slipped through the cracks, so to speak. Some people claim expertise in areas where there is no genuine expertise: if there is no knowledge or we'll justified belief in a domain (as opposed to mere beliefs or opinions), then there are no experts in that domain. And there are charlatans, people who, for a variety of reasons, present themselves as experts, even though they are not experts and they know it.Identifying who and who is not an expert is sometimes challenging. But it'snot impossible or not worth trying. And, again, sometimes it's clear who the experts are. 3. Skepticism About Experts People who haven't had the education, training, or practice of an expert are far less likely to be as skilled or knowledgeable in that domain, compared to an expert. So, expert guidance is more likely to be correct or useful than our own: this is why experts matter.[11]Some people, however, are skeptical of experts and even the whole idea ofexpertise.[12] Here are some reasons why:A. Expert opinion sometimes changes:We all know of cases where it seems like the experts got it wrong: butter was bad for you, now it's fine; all women should get mammograms, now it's only women over 50; one doctor told you X, but another said Y. Ever changing expert opinion sometimes leads people to doubt experts in general.B. Experts sometimes overreach:Experts sometimes overstep their bounds. They make claims about subjects outside their expertise, e.g., physicians offering political commentary. When experts present themselves as authorities in areas outside of their expertise,it is harder to know who the genuine experts are and it's easier to lose respect for experts.C. Experts sometimes disagree:Even genuine experts – people with equally strong training and experience sometimes disagree. TV courtroom dramas make much of this: You bring your experts; we'll bring ours.” If we can't decide which expert is more likely correct, we might lose confidence in experts generally.D. We sometimes resist expert authority:Experts sometimes tell us things we just don't want to hear, and so we refuse to listen. We are so confident that we are right that we dismiss anyone who contradicts us, including experts.[13] Sometimes this is because a belief is so important to us that we are offended by the idea that others know more about it than we do. When we claim expertise that we really don't have, this is often at our own peril.Recognizing why people sometimes reject expertise can make us more critical of that rejection. Sometimes skepticism about experts is justified. But, more often, experts are in better positions than us in knowing what we should think or do, and so skepticism is unwise. 4. Conclusion Studying expertise helps us better identify experts and understand why they are important.Many questions remain, however, e.g.: what should we believe, and do, when experts disagree?[14] Could recognizing the value of expertise discourage democracy, which allows non experts '' opinions to influence important decisions and policies?[15] Are there experts on controversial topics, like ethics or justice or politics?[16] Finally, are these all just questions for experts, or should everyone try to answer them as best they can",25 October 2018,Jamie Carlin Watson

Is that fear rational The ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus (341 270 BCE) says no. He argues that death as the permanent extinction of consciousness is not bad, so we should not fear it. The Roman philosopher Lucretius (94 circa 55 BCE) agrees, and he defends Epicurus.If Epicurus and Lucretius are right, then fear of death is irrational. But are they right?![By The Death Bed, 1896 by EdvardMunch](https://1000wordphilosophy.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/by-the-death-bed-1.jpg?w=656&h=490)By The Death Bed, 1896 by Edvard Munch 1. Epicurus' Argument Death, Epicurus argued, cannot touch us because while we exist death is not present, and when death is present we no longer exist.” Since death cannot touch us it cannot be bad. Fear is rational only for something bad. So Epicurus concludes that fearing death is pointless.[1]To be clear: the issue is being dead, not dying, since while dying we still exist. Dying can be awful and so rightly feared. 2. Reaction to Epicurus Common sense has long recoiled to Epicurus. Surely death is bad if it deprives us of the goods of life. Granted, if continued life would be terrible, then death might not deprive. But if it does deprive us of good experiences, then it is bad because it is bad to be deprived of any good.[2] 3. Lucretius' Argument This common sense reaction to Epicurus plays right into Lucretius' hands. For if we say that death is bad because it deprives us of time alive, then when we were born also deprives us of time alive, since we could have been born earlier than we were (or whenever we began to exist). However, since no one fears missing out on time before they were born, they should not fear missing out on time after they die.Lucretius writes:Look back again to see how the past ages of everlasting time, before we were born, have been as naught to us. These then nature holds up to us as a mirror of the time that is to come, when we are dead and gone. Is there aught that looks terrible in this, aught that seems gloomy Is it not a calmer rest than any sleep?[3] 4. Responding to Lucretius If we concede that being born late is just as bad as dying “early,” then maybe we should lament both when we were born and when we will die.[4]However, this is hard to believe and even harder to actually do.Alternatively, even if our non existence before birth and after death both deprive, maybe death deprives us of something we care about, whereas we are in different to time we missed before we were born.[5] That is, we could simply have a preference for the future.[6]However, even if true, this preference merely explains why we care about missing future goods by dying when we will instead of the goods we missed by being born when we were. Lucretius' claim is that our preference is irrational, since the two periods of non existence are symmetrical, so we should have similar attitudes toward them. Lucretius can even agree that we are biased toward the future; that, he would say, is the problem! 5. A Different Answer to Lucretius Here is a more promising response.[7] I might die later than I will, but I could not have been born earlier than I was. Anyone born earlier would not be me, because different gametes would produce a different individual.[8] If so,then I can rationally lament the one but not the other.But here's a problem: if particular gametes determine one's identity, in vitro fertilization (IVF) shows how the same human being could exist earlier.[9] If the embryo from which a person developed were implanted earlier than it was,it seems that that same person could have existed earlier than she did.The earlier IVF human being would indeed be identical to the later one, but the term human being is ambiguous between human organism,” which is abiological concept, and “ person ,” which is a metaphysical concept.Permanent coma victims, for example, are obviously human organisms, but not persons in the sense in which you are a person, namely, as a center of rational self awareness. Conversely, Superman, were he to exist, would be a person in that sense, though obviously not a member of our species .So the embryo could have been implanted earlier, which would have resulted in the same human organism as the later implanted embryo, but would it have given rise to the same person?[10]We care about the details of our lives. Our concerns, memories, hopes,relationships, and all that makes our lives worth living matters to each of us. That is what death threatens. Call this our thick personhood,” to distinguish it from the bare human organism shorn of one's biographicallife.[11] So even if an earlier existing human organism would be identical toa later existing one, that is not what matters to each of us.[12]If I die tomorrow (contrary to fact, I fervently hope!), I can nevertheless easily imagine extending my established biography past tomorrow, but I cannot imagine my biography beginning earlier than it did. How, for example, could I have met my wife before she was born Unless we can somehow push everything back in time in lock step unison, our thick person hoods cannot possibly exist earlier than they do.[13]We cannot be deprived of impossible things, such as the cake we ate yesterday.Since it is impossible for thick persons to exist earlier than they do, one cannot be deprived of time before birth. But it is possible to die later than one will, so we can be deprived of that time.[14] If so, this answers Lucretius. 6. Conclusion So to return to the intuitive response to Epicurus: since death typically deprives us of good life experiences, that's what makes it bad, thus justifying some appropriate level of fear. That's what most of us thought initially, and it looks like we were right.",2 October 2020,"Frederik Kaufman Categories: Ethics, Metaphysics, Historical Philosophy Word count: 987 Most people think dying would be bad for them and so they fear it.

Annoyed, you take it to a bike 'shop to determine the cau'se in order to fix the problem. The mechanic in form's you that the problem cannot be fixed becau'se there i's no rea'son why your bike drop's it''s chain: it ju'st doe's. It''s not that the cau'se of the chain dropping ha's not been determined: it''s that there i's no cau'se why thi's i'shappening.Gottfri ed Leibniz''s ' Principle of Suffici ent Rea'son (PSR) entail's that the bike mechanic''s claim i's patently fal'se:“No fact can hold or be real, and no propo'sition can be true, unle's's there i's a 'suffici ent rea'son why it i's 'so and not otherwi'se.”[1]According to the PSR, there are no brute, unexplained fact's; no un cau'sed event's or anything happening without a cau'se; and no claim's or beli ef's are true without there being a rea'son why they're true. Thi's e's'say will explain why Leibniz accepted the PSR, it''s variou's application's, and it''s place in contemporary philo'sophy. 1. Leibniz''s PSR Leibniz (1646 - 1716) i's the ' Principle of Suffici ent Rea'son ''s mo'st famou'sproponent, but he''s not the fir'st to adopt it. The earli e'st recorded application of the PSR 'seem's to be Anaximander c. 547 BCE:“The earth 'stay's at re'st becau'se of equality, 'since it i's no more fitting for what i's 'situated at the center and i's equally far from the extreme's to move up rather than down or 'sideway's.”[2]Al'so prior to Leibniz, Parmenide's, Archimede's, Abel ard, Spinoza, and Anne Conway were all proponent's of 'some form of the principle.Leibniz never explicitly offer's an argument for the PSR, but it''s 'sugge'sted byhi's definition of truth in thi's pa's'sage:“… it i's evident that all truth's … have an a priori [i.e., not 'sen'sory-ba'sed]proof, or 'some rea'son why they are truth's rather than not. And thi's i's ju'stwhat i's meant when it i's commonly 'said that nothing happen's without a cau'se,or, that there i's nothing without a rea'son.”[3]Other remark's 'sugge'st that he might accept 'some rea'soning like thi's:All 'statement's involve a 'subject and a predicate, e.g., 'Wa'shington cro's'sedthe Delaware.' 'Wa'shington' i's the 'subject. 'Cro's'sed the Delaware' i's the predicate. Leibniz claim's that a true 'statement i's one where the predicate“belong's” to the 'subject. Since Wa'shington did cro's's the Delaware River, the'statement 'Wa'shington cro's'sed the Delaware' i's true.[4] Now, it i'sn't anece's'sary truth that Wa'shington cro's'sed the Delaware: it could have been theca'se that Wa'shington didn't cro's's the Delaware; hi's cro's'sing i's a contingent truth: true, but could have been fal'se. In the ca'se of a nece's'sary truth,e.g., '' Mary the bachelorette i's unmarri ed,' it''s obviou's why the predicatebelong's to the 'subject: the predicate 'i's unmarri ed' belong's to ' Mary becau'seit would be a contradiction to a's'sert otherwi'se. To be a bachelorette i's to beunmarri ed. But how i's it that 'cro's'sing the Delaware' belong's to 'Wa'shington'?There mu'st be a rea'son.Voila! We have the PSR.[5] 2. Application's of the PSR Leibniz draw's 'some important con'sequence's from the PSR. Hi's '' Principle of the Identity of Indi'scernible's,' that if what 'seem to be two di'stinct thing's'share all of their properti e's, then they are actually one and the 'same thing, follow's from the PSR. Suppo'se there 'seemed to be two indi'scernible 'sphere's,'sharing all of their properti e's: each made of chemically pure iron, had a diameter of one mile, had the 'same temperature, color, and 'so on….”[6] But then there would be no 'suffici ent rea'son for either one of the indi'scernible'sphere's to be in the place it currently occupi e's and not the other. Therefore,by the PSR, if what 'seem to be two thing's 'share all of their properti e's,then they are actually one and the 'same thing: there''s only one 'sphere.![two'sphere's](http's://1000wordphilo'sophy.file's.wordpre's's.com/2018/03/two'sphere's.jpg?w=656)Leibniz al'so u'se's the PSR to develop a co'smological argument for God''sexi'stence. Returning to the bicycle example, 'say that you're able to explain the dropping of it''s chain becau'se of mi's aligned gear's. But then a furtherque'stion ari'se's: Why were the gear's mi's aligned? And 'so on and on. Explaining a contingent truth with another contingent truth face's an infinite chain of why que'stion's. A chain of an'swer's to why que'stion's that fizzle's out orcontinue's indefinitely cannot con'stitute a 'suffici ent rea'son. Such a rea'sonmu'st go out'side the 'seri e's of contingenci e's. Indeed, Leibniz claim's that any'succe's'sful pur'suit for rea'son's mu'st end with a “nece's'sary 'sub'stance”—a'sub'stance that exi'st's nece's'sarily, namely, God.The PSR play's an important role in Leibniz''s account of God''s creation:“Since there i's an infinity of po's'sible univer'se's in God''s idea's, and 'since only one of them can exi'st, there mu'st be a 'suffici ent rea'son for God''schoice, a rea'son which determine's him toward's one thing rather thananother.”[7]In other word's, there i's no other po's'sible univer'se on par with our own,becau'se otherwi'se God would have created neither.[8]Leibniz al'so employ's the PSR to reject Newton''s ab'soluti'st conception of 'space and time:“[Newton beli eved that] 'space i's 'something ab'solutely uniform, and without thething's placed in it, one point of 'space ab'solutely doe's not differ in any way from another point of 'space. Now, it follow's … that it i's impo's'sible there'should be a rea'son why God, pre'serving the 'same 'situation's of bodi e's amongthem'selve's, 'should have placed them in 'space after one certain particular manner and not otherwi'se …. The ca'se i's the 'same with re'spect to time.”[9]Leibniz''s own vi ew i's that 'space i's the order of co-exi'sting thing's and their'state's, and nothing more. Time i's 'simply the order of 'succe's'sive thing's and their 'state's. 3. Conclu'sionWolff and Schopenhauer, among other's, defended ver'sion's of the PSR after Leibniz, but the PSR ha's never been the con'sen'su's vi ew of philo'sopher's; Plato,De'scarte's, and Hume were all detractor's, to name ju'st three.[10] Leibniz''sconcern to avoid brute fact's, uncau'sed event's, and truth's without rea'son's,however, remain's a living concern for contemporary philo'sopher's, although the terminology often differ's.[11]",27 March 2018,Marc Bobro

Miller  Category: Ethics, Historical Philosophy  Word count: 994 One important question in ethics is what makes people's lives go well for them. Philosophers have proposed various theori es about what things in and of themselves make people better off, i.e., theori es of “well being.”Many such theori es say that pleasurable experi ences are at least part of what makes our lives go well. But do some types of pleasure contribute more to our well being than others The 19 th century philosopher John Stuart Mill (1806 73) answers “yes.” This discussion explains why.![John StuartMill](https://1000wordphilosophy.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/john-stuart-mill-small.jpg?w=656)John Stuart Mill 1. Mill's Hedonism Mill contends that pleasure is not merely one thing that contributes to our well being, it's the only thing. Similarly, only pain makes us worse off. Mill thinks that a person's life goes well for her just insofar as she is happy.Mill defines happiness as pleasure and freedom from pain. In his Utilitarianism , he describes the best life as an existence exempt as far as possible from pain, and as rich as possible in enjoyments.”[1] This theory of well being is called “hedonism.”[2]Mill's case for hedonism comes in Ch. 4 of Utilitarianism , in his so called proof of the principle of utility.”[3] There he contends that the sole evidence … that anything is desirable, is that people do actually desireit.”[4] Because pleasure is the only thing that we desire for it's own sake,Mill argues, we can know that it's uniquely valuable. 2. Bentham and Pushpin An earli er utilitarian philosopher, Jeremy Bentham (1748 1832), also subscribes to hedonism.[5] However, his hedonism differs significantly fromMill's.For Bentham, how much a pleasurable experi ence adds to our happiness is strictly a matter of how much pleasure it contains. This in turn depends on the intensity of the pleasure and how long it lasts. So two factors,intensity and duration , determine a pleasurable experi ence's value.Bentham sees the source of pleasure as irrelevant to it's value. He compares reading poetry with playing the mindless game “push-pin.”[6] As Mill'summarizes Bentham's conclusion, quantity of pleasure being equal, push pin is as good as poetry.”[7] 3. Qualitative Hedonism: A Plurality of Pleasures While Bentham may beli eve that pleasure is a single feeling that's present in all pleasurable experi ences. In contrast, Mill beli eves that there are distinct vari eti es of pleasures; a person may enjoy both reading poetry and running, but the pleasures these activiti es yi eld can have entirely different“feels.”It's therefore possible that some “ kinds of pleasure are more desirable and more valuable than others.”[8] Mill beli eves that some are; certain qualitatively superior pleasures add more to our happiness than an equal or even greater quantity of others. For Mill, therefore, the value of a pleasurable experi ence depends on three factors: intensity, duration, and(unlike Bentham) quality. 4. The Competent Judges Test How do we compare the quality of pleasures Mill says that we must consult people who have enjoyed both. Only they are competent to make this comparison.If they unequivocally desire one more strongly, then it's of higher quality:Of two pleasures, if there be one to which all or almost all who haveexperi ence of both give a decided preference, irrespective of any feeling of moral obligation to prefer it, that is the more desirable pleasure.[9]Note the continuity with Mill's proof: the sole evidence that one pleasure is more desirable is that people do actually desire it more strongly.Mill beli eves that the results of this test are apparent. While virtually everyone has experi ences of bodily pleasures that we share with animals, only some people are suffici ently mentally cultivated to enjoy the distinctly human pleasures of the intellect, of the feelings and imagination, and of the moral sentiments to any extent.[10] Those who are, he claims, decidedly preferthem:Now it is an unquestionable fact that those who are equally acquainted with,and equally capable of appreciating and enjoying, both, do give a most marked preference to the manner of existence which employs their higherfaculti es.[11]This lets Mill answer the objection that hedonists would approve of a person'sliving a life worthy only of swine,” as long as she enjoyed it.[12] His qualitative hedonism can explain why, although such a life would have some value (since lower quality pleasures have some value), she'd be far happi erand much better off were her life rich in higher quality pleasures.[13]One practical upshot of Mill's vi ew is the importance of providing an education suffici ent for enjoying higher quality pleasures to everyone. People lacking such preparation may not appreciate why these pleasures are superior,but they're not competent judges:It is better to be a human being dissatisfi ed than a pig satisfi ed; better tobe Socrates dissatisfi ed than a fool satisfi ed. And if the fool, or the pig,are a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of thequestion.[14] 5. Unanswered questions Some important questions about Mill's vi ews do not receive clear answers. One is whether there are qualitative differences between pains. The other is just how much more valuable than bodily pleasures higher quality pleasures are.Clearly he considers them significantly more valuable; controversially, some scholars beli eve that he considers them infinitely more valuable.[15] 6. Conclusion: Is Mill's Qualitative Hedonism Plausible Mill may seem to underrate the value of bodily pleasures. His vi ew could seem to entail that we should all spend as much time as possible on “rarifi ed”activiti es like museum visit's and opera, and none on exciting pursuit's like sports or sex.However, people with developed faculti es can find higher quality pleasure in diverse activiti es and combined with other pleasures. Someone who knows football well may derive intellectual and aesthetic pleasure from it, along with less refined pleasure in the collisions. Sex can be both emotionally fulfilling and physically pleasurable. Mill suggests that the best lives combine tranquility and excitement.[16]It also bears mentioning that Mill had a somewhat unusual life, starting with a childhood that involved little if any play. So he may not have been entirely competent to judge some bodily pleasures himself.[17]",26 September 2020,Dale E. Miller

Nasty divorce Hire a good lawyer. In short, if you've got a hard question or problem, you should seek the guidance of an expert.Experts don't just guide personal choices: they shape social policy, law and collective decision making: how should scientific research be interpreted What unintended consequences might result from this policy Is this proposed law le gally viable Experts help answer hard questions like these.But what is an expert How can we tell if someone is an expert And, since experts are important, why do people often reject their advice?![expertise](https://1000wordphilosophy.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/expertise.jpe g?w=656&h=557) 1. What is expertise There are many types of experts. Some experts – e.g., physicists, art historians, accountants – have exceptional knowledge. Others – e.g., chessmaster s, professional violinists, surgeons – have exceptional abilities. Some expertise relates less to doing and more to perceiving : e.g., an expert distiller can taste the nuances in whiskey; an expert radiologist can read an X ray efficiently.[1]Despite these differences, all experts have a high de gree of competence in a specific domain (or subject area) that makes them an authority in thatdomain.[2]Becoming an expert typically requires thousands of hours of focused study and practice.[3] Other experts usually review this practice and give feedback,leading to more practice.[4] Because expertise develops over time, someone can be more or less of an expert.[5] Expertise requires continual study and practice or else it can be lost.Experts are not simply reservoirs of information; they have a deep understanding of their domain, usually including how and why it's claims areaccepted.[6] They are not dabblers or merely we'll informed: they areauthorities.The authority of an expert is epistemic : their knowledge and understanding gives us good reason to trust them in matters of their domain of expertise.[7]Our beliefs are more likely to be justified or true if we get them fromexperts.[8] Experts, then, make us better off, by sharing their knowledge or using their skills. 2. How can we tell whether someone is an expertSometimes it's clear that someone is an expert: the proof is in their performance, e.g., gold medal winners, trial winning attorneys. Other times,it's harder to tell.There are, however, some general indicators that someone is likely an expert. Experts usually:   have extensive specialized education and experience;   have a track record of being right or helpful;   have high professional standing or credentials;   have marks of professional achievement, such as publications or awards;   can speak easily and confidently about their domain.[9]These indicators aren't perfect. Some de gree programs, credentials and awardsdon't amount to much. Some fields don't have track records, or they aren'tavailable. Some experts tend to lose skill with greater experience.[10] Some we'll meaning people claim to be among the experts in a domain, and even have credentials and experience, but they simply are not experts: they slipped through the cracks, so to speak. Some people claim expertise in areas where there is no genuine expertise: if there is no knowledge or we'll justified belief in a domain (as opposed to mere beliefs or opinions), then there are no experts in that domain. And there are charlatans, people who, for a variety of reasons, present themselves as experts, even though they are not experts and they know it.Identifying who and who is not an expert is sometimes challenging. But it'snot impossible or not worth trying. And, again, sometimes it's clear who the experts are. 3. Skepticism About Experts People who haven't had the education, training, or practice of an expert are far less likely to be as skilled or knowledgeable in that domain, compared to an expert. So, expert guidance is more likely to be correct or useful than our own: this is why experts matter.[11]Some people, however, are skeptical of experts and even the whole idea ofexpertise.[12] Here are some reasons why:A. Expert opinion sometimes changes:We all know of cases where it seems like the experts got it wrong: butter was bad for you, now it's fine; all women should get mammograms, now it's only women over 50; one doctor told you X, but another said Y. Ever changing expert opinion sometimes leads people to doubt experts in general.B. Experts sometimes overreach:Experts sometimes overstep their bounds. They make claims about subjects outside their expertise, e.g., physicians offering political commentary. When experts present themselves as authorities in areas outside of their expertise,it is harder to know who the genuine experts are and it's easier to lose respect for experts.C. Experts sometimes disagree:Even genuine experts – people with equally strong training and experience sometimes disagree. TV courtroom dramas make much of this: You bring your experts; we'll bring ours.” If we can't decide which expert is more likely correct, we might lose confidence in experts generally.D. We sometimes resist expert authority:Experts sometimes tell us things we just don't want to hear, and so we refuse to listen. We are so confident that we are right that we dismiss anyone who contradicts us, including experts.[13] Sometimes this is because a belief is so important to us that we are offended by the idea that others know more about it than we do. When we claim expertise that we really don't have, this is often at our own peril.Recognizing why people sometimes reject expertise can make us more critical of that rejection. Sometimes skepticism about experts is justified. But, more often, experts are in better positions than us in knowing what we should think or do, and so skepticism is unwise. 4. Conclusion Studying expertise helps us better identify experts and understand why they are important.Many questions remain, however, e.g.: what should we believe, and do, when experts disagree?[14] Could recognizing the value of expertise discourage democracy, which allows non experts '' opinions to influence important decisions and policies?[15] Are there experts on controversial topics, like ethics or justice or politics?[16] Finally, are these all just questions for experts, or should everyone try to answer them as best they can",25 October 2018,Jamie Carlin Watson

And these are just a few philosophical topics.But what is ' philosophy ' The question is it'self a philosophical question. This essay surveys some answers.!['Philosophy' in a dictionary.](https://1000word' philosophy '.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/' philosophy 'dicitionary.jpg?w=656&h=317)'Philosophy'in a dictionary. 1. Defining Philosophy The most general definition of ' philosophy ' is that it is the pursuit of wisdom,truth, and knowledge.[1] Indeed, the word it'self means '' love of wisdom' inGreek.Whenever people think about deep, fundamental questions concerning the nature of the universe and ourselves, the limit's of human knowledge, their values and the meaning of life, they are thinking about ' philosophy '. Philosophical thinking is found in all parts of the world, present, and past.[2]In the academic world, ' philosophy ' distinguishes a certain area of study from all other areas, such as the sci ences and other humaniti es. Philosophers typically consider questions that are, in some sense, broader and or more fundamental than other inquirers' questions:[3] e.g. physicists ask what caused some event; philosophers ask whether causation even exists ;historians study figures who fought for justice; philosophers ask what justice is or whether their causes were in fact just; economists study the allocation of capital; philosophers debate the ethical merit's of capitalism.When a topic becomes amenable to rigorous, empirical study, it tends to be outsourced to it's own fi eld, and not described in the present day as ' philosophy ' anymore: e.g., the natural sci ences were once called “natural' philosophy ',” but we don't now just think about whether matter is composed of atoms or infinitely divisible: we use sci entific experiments.[4] And most of the different doctoral de grees are called Doctor of Philosophy even whenthey're in sociology or chemistry.Philosophical questions can't be straightforwardly investigated through purely empirical means:[5] e.g. try to imagine a lab experiment testing whether soci eti es should privile ge equality over freedom not whether people beli eve we should, but whether we actually should. What does moral importance look like in a microscope The main method of academic ' philosophy ' is to construct and evaluate arguments (i.e. reasons intended to justify some conclusion). Such conclusions might be that some theory is true or false or might be about the correct analysis or definition of some concept. These arguments generally have at least some conceptual, intellectual, or a priori , i.e., non empirical, content. And philosophers often incorporate relevant sci entificknowledge as premises in arguments.[6] 2. Branches of Philosophy Philosophy deals with fundamental questions. But which questions,specifically, is ' philosophy ' about Here's a standard cate gorization:[7]Logic : Logicians study good and bad arguments and reasoning, and they study formal, symbolic languages intended to express propositions, sentences, orarguments.[8]Metaphysics : Meta physicians study what sorts of entiti es exist, what the world and it's constituents are made of, and how objects or events might cause or explain each other.[9]Epistemology : Epistemologists study knowledge, evidence, and justifi edbeli ef. An epistemologist might study whether we can trust our senses and whether sci ence is trustworthy.[10]Values : In value theory, philosophers study morality, politics, and art,among other topics. For example: What makes wrong actions wrong How do we identify good people and good lives What makes a soci ety just or unjust?[11]There are many sub branches within these fi elds. Many other fi elds— thesci ences, art, literature, and religion have a ' philosophy ' of attached to them: e.g. philosophers of sci ence might help interpret quantum mechanics;philosophers of religion often consider arguments about the existence ofGod.[12]There are also unique and important philosophical discussions about certain populations or communiti es, such as feminist ' philosophy ' and Africana' philosophy '.[13] People from all cultures contribute to ' philosophy ', more than are typically discussed in Western ' philosophy ' courses.[14] Western academic ' philosophy ' has often ne glected voices from non Western cultures, and women'svoices.[15]Philosophers sometimes import tools, knowledge, and language from otherfi elds, such as using the formal tools of statistics in epistemology and the insights from special relativity in the ' philosophy ' of time.[16] When your project is understanding all of existence[17] in the broadest and most fundamental way, you need all the help you can get. 3. The Point(s) of Philosophy Academic ' philosophy ' doesn't present a body of consensus knowledge the way chemistry and physics do.[18] Do philosophical questions have correct answers Does philosophical progress exist Does ' philosophy ' get closer to the truth over time?[19] These are all matters of philosophical debate.[20] And philosophical debates are rarely resolved with certainty.So what's the point Here are some answers:[21]   To discover truth, wherever and whatever it is.[22]   To learn how to better live our lives.[23]   To understand our own vi ews, including their strengths and weaknesses.   To examine our own lives and be more conscious of our choices and their implications.   To learn how to better think and reason. Recall: The main method of ' philosophy ' is to present and examine arguments.[24]And arguably, all of us are already naturally interested in at least some philosophical questions. Many people find that ' philosophy ' is a lot of fun. Andit's difficult to dispute that it is very important to find the answers to philosophical questions, if the answers exist. It's important to know, for instance, that slavery is wrong and whether sci entific consensus is generally trustworthy. So as long as it's at least possible to find the answers to these questions, we should try.Also, there are strong correlations between studying ' philosophy ' and highachi evement in other academic areas, such as GRE scores and professional school admission.[25] 4. ConclusionWe've contrasted ' philosophy ' with other fi elds. We've looked at the branches of ' philosophy '. And we've looked at the purposes or benefit's of ' philosophy '. But what is ' philosophy ', really Given everything we've said so far, we can provide at least a partial definition of '' philosophy '' as follows:A largely (but not exclusively) non empirical inquiry that attempts to identify and answer fundamental questions about the world, including aboutwhat's valuable and disvaluable.Is this a good definition That's a philosophical question too.

Annoyed, you take it to a bike 'shop to determine the cau'se in order to fix the problem. The mechanic in form's you that the problem cannot be fixed becau'se there i's no rea'son why your bike drop's it''s chain: it ju'st doe's. It''s not that the cau'se of the chain dropping ha's not been determined: it''s that there i's no cau'se why thi's i'shappening.Gottfri ed Leibniz''s ' Principle of Suffici ent Rea'son (PSR) entail's that the bike mechanic''s claim i's patently fal'se:“No fact can hold or be real, and no propo'sition can be true, unle's's there i's a 'suffici ent rea'son why it i's 'so and not otherwi'se.”[1]According to the PSR, there are no brute, unexplained fact's; no un cau'sed event's or anything happening without a cau'se; and no claim's or beli ef's are true without there being a rea'son why they're true. Thi's e's'say will explain why Leibniz accepted the PSR, it''s variou's application's, and it''s place in contemporary philo'sophy. 1. Leibniz''s PSR Leibniz (1646 - 1716) i's the ' Principle of Suffici ent Rea'son ''s mo'st famou'sproponent, but he''s not the fir'st to adopt it. The earli e'st recorded application of the PSR 'seem's to be Anaximander c. 547 BCE:“The earth 'stay's at re'st becau'se of equality, 'since it i's no more fitting for what i's 'situated at the center and i's equally far from the extreme's to move up rather than down or 'sideway's.”[2]Al'so prior to Leibniz, Parmenide's, Archimede's, Abel ard, Spinoza, and Anne Conway were all proponent's of 'some form of the principle.Leibniz never explicitly offer's an argument for the PSR, but it''s 'sugge'sted byhi's definition of truth in thi's pa's'sage:“… it i's evident that all truth's … have an a priori [i.e., not 'sen'sory-ba'sed]proof, or 'some rea'son why they are truth's rather than not. And thi's i's ju'stwhat i's meant when it i's commonly 'said that nothing happen's without a cau'se,or, that there i's nothing without a rea'son.”[3]Other remark's 'sugge'st that he might accept 'some rea'soning like thi's:All 'statement's involve a 'subject and a predicate, e.g., 'Wa'shington cro's'sedthe Delaware.' 'Wa'shington' i's the 'subject. 'Cro's'sed the Delaware' i's the predicate. Leibniz claim's that a true 'statement i's one where the predicate“belong's” to the 'subject. Since Wa'shington did cro's's the Delaware River, the'statement 'Wa'shington cro's'sed the Delaware' i's true.[4] Now, it i'sn't anece's'sary truth that Wa'shington cro's'sed the Delaware: it could have been theca'se that Wa'shington didn't cro's's the Delaware; hi's cro's'sing i's a contingent truth: true, but could have been fal'se. In the ca'se of a nece's'sary truth,e.g., '' Mary the bachelorette i's unmarri ed,' it''s obviou's why the predicatebelong's to the 'subject: the predicate 'i's unmarri ed' belong's to ' Mary becau'seit would be a contradiction to a's'sert otherwi'se. To be a bachelorette i's to beunmarri ed. But how i's it that 'cro's'sing the Delaware' belong's to 'Wa'shington'?There mu'st be a rea'son.Voila! We have the PSR.[5] 2. Application's of the PSR Leibniz draw's 'some important con'sequence's from the PSR. Hi's '' Principle of the Identity of Indi'scernible's,' that if what 'seem to be two di'stinct thing's'share all of their properti e's, then they are actually one and the 'same thing, follow's from the PSR. Suppo'se there 'seemed to be two indi'scernible 'sphere's,'sharing all of their properti e's: each made of chemically pure iron, had a diameter of one mile, had the 'same temperature, color, and 'so on….”[6] But then there would be no 'suffici ent rea'son for either one of the indi'scernible'sphere's to be in the place it currently occupi e's and not the other. Therefore,by the PSR, if what 'seem to be two thing's 'share all of their properti e's,then they are actually one and the 'same thing: there''s only one 'sphere.![two'sphere's](http's://1000wordphilo'sophy.file's.wordpre's's.com/2018/03/two'sphere's.jpg?w=656)Leibniz al'so u'se's the PSR to develop a co'smological argument for God''sexi'stence. Returning to the bicycle example, 'say that you're able to explain the dropping of it''s chain becau'se of mi's aligned gear's. But then a furtherque'stion ari'se's: Why were the gear's mi's aligned? And 'so on and on. Explaining a contingent truth with another contingent truth face's an infinite chain of why que'stion's. A chain of an'swer's to why que'stion's that fizzle's out orcontinue's indefinitely cannot con'stitute a 'suffici ent rea'son. Such a rea'sonmu'st go out'side the 'seri e's of contingenci e's. Indeed, Leibniz claim's that any'succe's'sful pur'suit for rea'son's mu'st end with a “nece's'sary 'sub'stance”—a'sub'stance that exi'st's nece's'sarily, namely, God.The PSR play's an important role in Leibniz''s account of God''s creation:“Since there i's an infinity of po's'sible univer'se's in God''s idea's, and 'since only one of them can exi'st, there mu'st be a 'suffici ent rea'son for God''schoice, a rea'son which determine's him toward's one thing rather thananother.”[7]In other word's, there i's no other po's'sible univer'se on par with our own,becau'se otherwi'se God would have created neither.[8]Leibniz al'so employ's the PSR to reject Newton''s ab'soluti'st conception of 'space and time:“[Newton beli eved that] 'space i's 'something ab'solutely uniform, and without thething's placed in it, one point of 'space ab'solutely doe's not differ in any way from another point of 'space. Now, it follow's … that it i's impo's'sible there'should be a rea'son why God, pre'serving the 'same 'situation's of bodi e's amongthem'selve's, 'should have placed them in 'space after one certain particular manner and not otherwi'se …. The ca'se i's the 'same with re'spect to time.”[9]Leibniz''s own vi ew i's that 'space i's the order of co-exi'sting thing's and their'state's, and nothing more. Time i's 'simply the order of 'succe's'sive thing's and their 'state's. 3. Conclu'sionWolff and Schopenhauer, among other's, defended ver'sion's of the PSR after Leibniz, but the PSR ha's never been the con'sen'su's vi ew of philo'sopher's; Plato,De'scarte's, and Hume were all detractor's, to name ju'st three.[10] Leibniz''sconcern to avoid brute fact's, uncau'sed event's, and truth's without rea'son's,however, remain's a living concern for contemporary philo'sopher's, although the terminology often differ's.[11]",27 March 2018,Marc Bobro

Is that fear rational The ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus (341 270 BCE) says no. He argues that death as the permanent extinction of consciousness is not bad, so we should not fear it. The Roman philosopher Lucretius (94 circa 55 BCE) agrees, and he defends Epicurus.If Epicurus and Lucretius are right, then fear of death is irrational. But are they right?![By The Death Bed, 1896 by EdvardMunch](https://1000wordphilosophy.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/by-the-death-bed-1.jpg?w=656&h=490)By The Death Bed, 1896 by Edvard Munch 1. Epicurus' Argument Death, Epicurus argued, cannot touch us because while we exist death is not present, and when death is present we no longer exist.” Since death cannot touch us it cannot be bad. Fear is rational only for something bad. So Epicurus concludes that fearing death is pointless.[1]To be clear: the issue is being dead, not dying, since while dying we still exist. Dying can be awful and so rightly feared. 2. Reaction to Epicurus Common sense has long recoiled to Epicurus. Surely death is bad if it deprives us of the goods of life. Granted, if continued life would be terrible, then death might not deprive. But if it does deprive us of good experiences, then it is bad because it is bad to be deprived of any good.[2] 3. Lucretius' Argument This common sense reaction to Epicurus plays right into Lucretius' hands. For if we say that death is bad because it deprives us of time alive, then when we were born also deprives us of time alive, since we could have been born earlier than we were (or whenever we began to exist). However, since no one fears missing out on time before they were born, they should not fear missing out on time after they die.Lucretius writes:Look back again to see how the past ages of everlasting time, before we were born, have been as naught to us. These then nature holds up to us as a mirror of the time that is to come, when we are dead and gone. Is there aught that looks terrible in this, aught that seems gloomy Is it not a calmer rest than any sleep?[3] 4. Responding to Lucretius If we concede that being born late is just as bad as dying “early,” then maybe we should lament both when we were born and when we will die.[4]However, this is hard to believe and even harder to actually do.Alternatively, even if our non existence before birth and after death both deprive, maybe death deprives us of something we care about, whereas we are in different to time we missed before we were born.[5] That is, we could simply have a preference for the future.[6]However, even if true, this preference merely explains why we care about missing future goods by dying when we will instead of the goods we missed by being born when we were. Lucretius' claim is that our preference is irrational, since the two periods of non existence are symmetrical, so we should have similar attitudes toward them. Lucretius can even agree that we are biased toward the future; that, he would say, is the problem! 5. A Different Answer to Lucretius Here is a more promising response.[7] I might die later than I will, but I could not have been born earlier than I was. Anyone born earlier would not be me, because different gametes would produce a different individual.[8] If so,then I can rationally lament the one but not the other.But here's a problem: if particular gametes determine one's identity, in vitro fertilization (IVF) shows how the same human being could exist earlier.[9] If the embryo from which a person developed were implanted earlier than it was,it seems that that same person could have existed earlier than she did.The earlier IVF human being would indeed be identical to the later one, but the term human being is ambiguous between human organism,” which is abiological concept, and “ person ,” which is a metaphysical concept.Permanent coma victims, for example, are obviously human organisms, but not persons in the sense in which you are a person, namely, as a center of rational self awareness. Conversely, Superman, were he to exist, would be a person in that sense, though obviously not a member of our species .So the embryo could have been implanted earlier, which would have resulted in the same human organism as the later implanted embryo, but would it have given rise to the same person?[10]We care about the details of our lives. Our concerns, memories, hopes,relationships, and all that makes our lives worth living matters to each of us. That is what death threatens. Call this our thick personhood,” to distinguish it from the bare human organism shorn of one's biographicallife.[11] So even if an earlier existing human organism would be identical toa later existing one, that is not what matters to each of us.[12]If I die tomorrow (contrary to fact, I fervently hope!), I can nevertheless easily imagine extending my established biography past tomorrow, but I cannot imagine my biography beginning earlier than it did. How, for example, could I have met my wife before she was born Unless we can somehow push everything back in time in lock step unison, our thick person hoods cannot possibly exist earlier than they do.[13]We cannot be deprived of impossible things, such as the cake we ate yesterday.Since it is impossible for thick persons to exist earlier than they do, one cannot be deprived of time before birth. But it is possible to die later than one will, so we can be deprived of that time.[14] If so, this answers Lucretius. 6. Conclusion So to return to the intuitive response to Epicurus: since death typically deprives us of good life experiences, that's what makes it bad, thus justifying some appropriate level of fear. That's what most of us thought initially, and it looks like we were right.",2 October 2020,"Frederik Kaufman Categories: Ethics, Metaphysics, Historical Philosophy Word count: 987 Most people think dying would be bad for them and so they fear it.

Overall course grades are also often influenced by students' complying with class procedures:e.g., if attendance and participation are required, then students who rarely attend class may get poor grades, even if they understand the course content and have done well on the assignments and tests.A vari ety of extra credit opportuniti es are often given as a way to raise grades on assignments and tests and overall course grades. But there are reasons why instructors should not offer extra credit, that doing so is unjustifi ed and unfair. Extra credit is common but is surprisinglycontroversial.[1]![report card](https://1000wordphilosophy.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/report-card.jpg?w=656) 1. Arguments For Extra Credit Extra credit opportuniti es are often said to be justifi ed on the grounds that they:  1. motivate students to participate in research, e.g., being subjects in psychological experiments, and students learn from that participation;  2. get students involved in the life of the mind and encourage academic virtues, such as curiosity, creativity, and application;  3. encourage students to attend special events outside of class, e.g., guest lectures and special forums;  4. just help students get the grades that they want or “need.”These justifications are doubtful.About (1), if the, e.g., psychological studi es that students participate in as subjects are irrelevant to the course, then participation should not influence their grades: that grade should only reflect their understanding of course content. If the research is importantly relevant , then participation should be required, not extra credit. Imagine a class on all aspects of psychology research but where any participation in psychological research was extra credit, not required: that is a poorly designed course.About (2), educational research suggests that extra credit opportuniti es rarely contribute to ordinary students becoming “super-students.” And if the cultivation of academic virtues is a le gitimate goal, this can and should besought with re gular assignments. And academic virtues can be promoted by encouraging students to participate in campus intellectual activiti es even if extra credit is not given : participation without a grade enhancing reward displays virtue in it'self.About (3), if the content of the special event - lecture, forum - isn'trelevant to the course then, again, participation shouldn't influence grades.If it is relevant, then any students who attend should benefit from the experi ence, even without extra credit. But not all students can attend such events since they have other (school, work, family) responsibiliti es and obligations at that time. So, those who can attend get a special boost to their grade that those who cannot attend cannot get. That is not fair.Finally, about (4), students don't need passing grades, if they haven'tearned those grades. Students can fail classes; sometimes that's for the best. To help students pass, extra support, guidance, and tutoring can be provided; instructors can also try new teaching and course design strate gi esto address student difficulti es. Extra credit isn't needed to promote genuine student success.While there may be better arguments for extra credit not discussed here, the case in it's favor so far appears weak. 2. Arguments Against Extra Credit Extra credit opportuniti es are argued against in a vari ety of ways.A. Equal Opportunity Arguments:Christopher Pyne s observes that every student in a class should have an equal opportunity to earn the same grade as every other student.” Many extra credit opportuniti es, especially those outside of scheduled class time, e.g.,evening forums, hearing speakers at nearby schools and so on, are not equally available opportuniti es. As observed above, not all students can participate since they have le gitimate conflicting responsibiliti es. These forms of extra credit are unfair since some students' grades shouldn't increase because of points that not all students have an equal opportunity to receive.B. Easy or Hard Dilemmas and Grade Inflation Arguments :Extra credit options are typically either easy or hard. If they are hard then only the best students will complete them, and they already have high grades, but students who need extra credit, because they are not learning the re gular material and thus have poor grades, will not receive those points.Easy extra credit contributes to grade inflation,” i.e., grades higher than warranted by the students' understanding: a B earning student in a very hard class might receive an A because of fluff extra credit. And a student with aD level of understanding shouldn't get a B or A by doing a lot of easy extra credit. Extra credit can contribute to grades not accurately reflecting students '' understanding of the course material.C. Inequality Arguments:Studi es suggest that it's more often the best students who do extra credit assignments: they already have high grades. Students with poor grades tend to not take advantage of extra credit options. And if students are not doing well with the re gular assignments, it is unwise to burden them with even more assignment opportuniti es. So extra credit tends to make grade rich students richer and grade poor students potentially poorer, insofar as it can dilute their focus on the re gular work.D. '' Risky Proposition' Arguments:Extra credit opportuniti es may give students the sense that they can put less effort into re gular assignments because they can make it up with extra credit. This strate gy is risky. Having no extra credit temptations avoids this risk since students' attention to the re gular work is not divided (at least not by extra credit).E. Extra Work Arguments :In classes where a suffici ent and responsible amount of work is assigned,extra credit is more work for students and more grading for instructors. If the assignment is important, it should be a required assignment. If not, it can be eliminated without significant loss. If the assignment is fluff and the grading easy, points from it should not contribute to grades that indicate knowledge of non fluff material.These arguments seem compelling, but perhaps strong rebuttals could be developed. 3. Conclusion In conclusion, we might ask, Are any forms of extra credit not subject to an objection from above But would this be an acceptable extra credit question, given the arguments above",25 February 2018,Nathan Nobis

Miller  Category: Ethics, Historical Philosophy  Word count: 994 One important question in ethics is what makes people's lives go well for them. Philosophers have proposed various theori es about what things in and of themselves make people better off, i.e., theori es of “well being.”Many such theori es say that pleasurable experi ences are at least part of what makes our lives go well. But do some types of pleasure contribute more to our well being than others The 19 th century philosopher John Stuart Mill (1806 73) answers “yes.” This discussion explains why.![John StuartMill](https://1000wordphilosophy.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/john-stuart-mill-small.jpg?w=656)John Stuart Mill 1. Mill's Hedonism Mill contends that pleasure is not merely one thing that contributes to our well being, it's the only thing. Similarly, only pain makes us worse off. Mill thinks that a person's life goes well for her just insofar as she is happy.Mill defines happiness as pleasure and freedom from pain. In his Utilitarianism , he describes the best life as an existence exempt as far as possible from pain, and as rich as possible in enjoyments.”[1] This theory of well being is called “hedonism.”[2]Mill's case for hedonism comes in Ch. 4 of Utilitarianism , in his so called proof of the principle of utility.”[3] There he contends that the sole evidence … that anything is desirable, is that people do actually desireit.”[4] Because pleasure is the only thing that we desire for it's own sake,Mill argues, we can know that it's uniquely valuable. 2. Bentham and Pushpin An earli er utilitarian philosopher, Jeremy Bentham (1748 1832), also subscribes to hedonism.[5] However, his hedonism differs significantly fromMill's.For Bentham, how much a pleasurable experi ence adds to our happiness is strictly a matter of how much pleasure it contains. This in turn depends on the intensity of the pleasure and how long it lasts. So two factors,intensity and duration , determine a pleasurable experi ence's value.Bentham sees the source of pleasure as irrelevant to it's value. He compares reading poetry with playing the mindless game “push-pin.”[6] As Mill'summarizes Bentham's conclusion, quantity of pleasure being equal, push pin is as good as poetry.”[7] 3. Qualitative Hedonism: A Plurality of Pleasures While Bentham may beli eve that pleasure is a single feeling that's present in all pleasurable experi ences. In contrast, Mill beli eves that there are distinct vari eti es of pleasures; a person may enjoy both reading poetry and running, but the pleasures these activiti es yi eld can have entirely different“feels.”It's therefore possible that some “ kinds of pleasure are more desirable and more valuable than others.”[8] Mill beli eves that some are; certain qualitatively superior pleasures add more to our happiness than an equal or even greater quantity of others. For Mill, therefore, the value of a pleasurable experi ence depends on three factors: intensity, duration, and(unlike Bentham) quality. 4. The Competent Judges Test How do we compare the quality of pleasures Mill says that we must consult people who have enjoyed both. Only they are competent to make this comparison.If they unequivocally desire one more strongly, then it's of higher quality:Of two pleasures, if there be one to which all or almost all who haveexperi ence of both give a decided preference, irrespective of any feeling of moral obligation to prefer it, that is the more desirable pleasure.[9]Note the continuity with Mill's proof: the sole evidence that one pleasure is more desirable is that people do actually desire it more strongly.Mill beli eves that the results of this test are apparent. While virtually everyone has experi ences of bodily pleasures that we share with animals, only some people are suffici ently mentally cultivated to enjoy the distinctly human pleasures of the intellect, of the feelings and imagination, and of the moral sentiments to any extent.[10] Those who are, he claims, decidedly preferthem:Now it is an unquestionable fact that those who are equally acquainted with,and equally capable of appreciating and enjoying, both, do give a most marked preference to the manner of existence which employs their higherfaculti es.[11]This lets Mill answer the objection that hedonists would approve of a person'sliving a life worthy only of swine,” as long as she enjoyed it.[12] His qualitative hedonism can explain why, although such a life would have some value (since lower quality pleasures have some value), she'd be far happi erand much better off were her life rich in higher quality pleasures.[13]One practical upshot of Mill's vi ew is the importance of providing an education suffici ent for enjoying higher quality pleasures to everyone. People lacking such preparation may not appreciate why these pleasures are superior,but they're not competent judges:It is better to be a human being dissatisfi ed than a pig satisfi ed; better tobe Socrates dissatisfi ed than a fool satisfi ed. And if the fool, or the pig,are a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of thequestion.[14] 5. Unanswered questions Some important questions about Mill's vi ews do not receive clear answers. One is whether there are qualitative differences between pains. The other is just how much more valuable than bodily pleasures higher quality pleasures are.Clearly he considers them significantly more valuable; controversially, some scholars beli eve that he considers them infinitely more valuable.[15] 6. Conclusion: Is Mill's Qualitative Hedonism Plausible Mill may seem to underrate the value of bodily pleasures. His vi ew could seem to entail that we should all spend as much time as possible on “rarifi ed”activiti es like museum visit's and opera, and none on exciting pursuit's like sports or sex.However, people with developed faculti es can find higher quality pleasure in diverse activiti es and combined with other pleasures. Someone who knows football well may derive intellectual and aesthetic pleasure from it, along with less refined pleasure in the collisions. Sex can be both emotionally fulfilling and physically pleasurable. Mill suggests that the best lives combine tranquility and excitement.[16]It also bears mentioning that Mill had a somewhat unusual life, starting with a childhood that involved little if any play. So he may not have been entirely competent to judge some bodily pleasures himself.[17]",26 September 2020,Dale E. Miller

Or suppose the male members of a board reject a female colleague's suggestions because they believe that women are too often irrational. Imagine also a woman whose postpartum depression is dismissed by her doctor as mere '' baby blues.'[1]All three people above suffer what contemporary English philosopher Miranda F ricker calls epistemic injustice.[2] Epistemic means relating to knowledge. Epistemic injustice refers to a wrong done to someone as a knower or transmitter of knowledge: due to unjustified prejudice, someone is unfairly judged to not have the knowledge or reasonable beliefs that they actuallyhave.F ricker identifies two forms of epistemic injustice: testimonial and her men e utica l. This essay explains these forms of epistemic injustice and surveys some suggestions for how to prevent them.![Miranda F ricker, ""EpistemicInjustice""](https://1000wordphilosophy.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/epistemic-injustice-miranda-fricker3.jpg?w=656)Miranda F ricker, ""Epistemic Injustice"" 1. Testimonial Injustice Testimony involves someone sharing their knowledge with someone else.Testimony typically happens when people communicate: e.g., giving directions,reporting the news, writing a research paper. Testimony isn't just statements in a courtroom: whenever we gain knowledge from other people, we rely on testimony. Testimony is credible when there's good reason to believe thatwhat's claimed is true, when the person testifying knows what they claim toknow.[3]A speaker suffers testimonial injustice when their testimony is judged to be not or less credible because of prejudice and not because the testimony it'self is unreasonable.[4] These prejudices can be related to race, gender,accent, age, and others and impact people in many areas of life: economic,educational, professional, sexual, le gal, political, religious, and more.Testimonial injustices caused by such prejudices constitute the central cases of testimonial injustice.Testimonial injustice can take various forms. For instance, a female boardmember's prediction might be rejected due to the prejudices of her malecolleague's: this is called testimonial quieting. Alternatively, that female board member might instead silence or limit her assertions beforehand knowing that she'll receive in appropriately low credibility: this is called testimonial smothering.[5] 2. Her men e utica l Injustice A second type of epistemic injustice is known as hermeneutical injustice.“Her men e utica l” relates to interpretation and understanding.Consider sexual harassment. Although this might be surprising, that concepthasn't always existed. So imagine a woman who is sexually harassed at her workplace before the introduction of the concept in the 1970s.[6] She lives in a society where unwanted sexual propositions are typically seen as a form of'flirting,' and rejection of them as a '' lack of a sense of humor.' Since she' lacks the concept of sexual harassment, she'll have difficulty understanding her experience adequately or finding the appropriate words to communicate it to others.Her men e utica l injustice then is about cases of ' lacking the concepts to adequately understand or communicate an experience. Her men e utica l injustice occurs when this failure is due ultimately to prejudices that result in people' lacking the concepts needed to understand or communicate their experiences.[7]The injustice above was due to women's (partial) exclusion from certainprofessions—e.g., journalism, politics, academics, law which tended to result in biased interpretations of women's experiences, as in interpreting sexual harassment as merely a form of flirting.Some argue that hermeneutical injustice doesn't require a ' lack of concepts since it can occur when interpretations of a certain group's experiences, and the result ing concepts, are unduly dismissed by others. For instance,postpartum depression might be dismissed as a personal deficiency rather thana genuine medical condition: this is called hermeneutical dissent.[8]Unlike testimonial injustice, hermeneutical injustice is not the result of an individual hearer's prejudice: no single agent perpetrates hermeneuticalinjustice.[9] In the sexual harassment example, it's not any individual'sprejudice, but prejudicial practices in society that resulted in people' lacking the concept of sexual harassment. 3. The Wrong of Epistemic Injustice Producing and spreading knowledge is part of being human. Epistemic injustice results in victim's' being at least partially excluded from participation in these activities.Epistemic injustice can lead to grave practical consequences for both victim's and wrongdoers. A wrongly disbelieved defendant might lose their freedom or life. Not listening to a board member who might have crucial knowledge for the future of the company may have dire consequences.Epistemic injustice also harms the victim's identity. We typically define ourselves partly by our group identities: racial, sexual, religious,political, and more. We construct this part of our identity largely by communicating with others or using the available conceptual resources. So,being considered untrustworthy or ' lacking the conceptual resources to make sense of our experiences potentially prevents us from constructing our own social identity from becoming who we are. If a woman who is interested in and has a talent for politics is constantly excluded from political dialogue, she can hardly fulfill her potential to become a politician.[10] 4. How to Prevent Epistemic Injustice To prevent epistemic injustice, F ricker suggests that we cultivate reliable character trait's—virtues—that neutralize prejudice.[11]We should aim to be aware of the potential prejudice in who we judge as credible. If we find that the low credibility we assigned to a speaker is due to prejudice, we should work to change that attitude.[12]Since victim's of prejudice can have undue difficulty articulating their experiences, we should try to make out how their experiences would be understood in a prejudice free climate.Some argue that individual efforts, though they should prove useful, may not be enough to defeat epistemic injustice. For instance, education is a marker of credibility. But the ' lack of proper education might be due to the absence of fair opportunities for education. So, some people are unfairly considered not credible and excluded from participation in knowledge related activities because of underlying injustice in social institutions. The solution then requires changes in social institutions, not just individual efforts.[13] 5. ConclusionIt's difficult to overestimate the value of being (recognized as) someone with knowledge. So it's difficult to overestimate the badness of knowledge relatedunfairness or epistemic injustice. Addressing and avoiding such injustice,however, requires both social and political change and, often, serious personal effort.",21 July 2020,"Huzeyfe Demirtas Categories: Epistemology, Ethics, Social and Political Philosophy, Philosophy of Sex and Gender, Philosophy of Race, Logic and Reasoning Wordcount: 996 Suppose a jury rejec…"" />

Many everyday objects with thosefeatures—e.g., watches and houses were intentionally designed. Should we conclude, therefore, that some of the natural objects in the universe, or the universe itself, was also intentionally designed If so, that designer might be God.![Photo from Astronaut Alexander Ger st Aboard The International SpaceStation](https://1000wordphilosophy.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/one-strange-rock-2.jpg?w=656) Photo from Astronaut Alexander Ger st aboard the International Space Station 1. The Arguments The standard '' Design '' or '' Teleological '' arguments for theism hold that there is evidence of design in nature and that this is evidence for the existence ofGod.[1]There are three general versions of this argument. '' Biological ' Design 'Arguments' claim that God designed some or all of the biological organisms in the universe.[2] '' Physical ' Design ' Arguments' (or '' Cosmic ' Design '' arguments)claim that God designed something about the large scale structure and contents of the universe, or its laws of nature, or the small scale structure of itscomponents.[3] '' Fine Tuning Arguments' claim that God intentionally chose the physical laws, fundamental constants, and initial conditions of the universe so the universe would permit complex, biological life.[4] 2. The Evidence' Biological organisms arguably exhibit interesting order, complexity, and purpose: e.g., the human eye. By analogy, if you were to find and examine a camera lying in a field somewhere, you would be irrational to conclude that it had formed mindlessly and naturally. You should instead notice that it has many parts, each serving a particular purpose, working together for a valuable, general function. But, of course, the human eye also has many parts,each serving a particular purpose, working together for a valuable, generalfunction.[5]One version of these arguments holds that some biological systems exhibit'irreducible complexity.' This occurs when some system would not be adaptive or useful unless all of its parts were present simultaneously.[6] As a simplified analogy, suppose that your immune system has two subsystems: a subsystem that detects and identifies invaders, and a subsystem that kills invaders and infected cells.[7] If your immune system lacked the first type of subsystem, then it would either not kill invaders, or it would also kill your own, healthy cells. If your immune system lacked the second type of subsystem,then it wouldn't do anything to the invaders it detected. Only if both types are present is the immune system adaptive. But surely the proponent of the argument insists—it's extremely unlikely that both subsystems should have independently evolved at the same time. Yet, of course, God could have created them both at once, there by creating a well functioning immune system.The physical universe itself, in the large scale, may also exhibit evidence ofdesign.[8] Perhaps the planets' orbiting their stars, and the probability clouds of electrons, are orderly enough to remind us of the carefully planned motion of mechanical systems inside a human designed machine. Of course,someone might object that the planets are simply following the laws of conservation of angular momentum and gravity,[9] but the proponent of the physical design argument can reply that laws of nature are also evidence of a designer.[10] Last, scientists generally agree that if certain features of the universe were slightly different say, if gravity were somewhat stronger or weaker then living beings like us would be physically impossible.[11] And there are alle gedly very many other examples of laws, constants, and initial conditions that must be delicately balanced for life to exist. Yet here we are. So, the argument goes, either we got extremely lucky perhaps as lucky as winning the lottery several times in a row[12]—or God fine tuned the universe to permit life like us. 3. Objections While design arguments have skilled defenders, most philosophers have not yet been persuaded.[13]One potential problem with biological design arguments is that we know of a powerful mechanism that can mindlessly produce order, complexity, and purpose:the mechanism of evolution by natural selection.[14] This might even explain irreducible complexity.”[15] For example, a species might evolve to have a simple immune system in which the same system both identifies and attacks invaders; and then evolve, in addition, a second kind of subsystem, which only identifies invaders (there by enhancing the power of the general immune system); and then evolve a third kind, which only attacks; and then cease to have the original system that does both.Another potential problem with biological design arguments is that living creatures may exhibit evidence of poor design.”[16] For example, human beings might have been better designed if we didn't use the same tube both to breathe and to swallow food. And we are vulnerable to several tragic, untreatable genetic diseases, such as Tay Sachs disease,[17] which chiefly affects young children. Given the hypothesis of a divine designer who is much more intelligent than we, it is puzzling that some creatures exhibit poor design.The philosopher David Hume challenged biological and physical design arguments in various ways. For example, he wondered whether God himself needs a designer, and whether mindless motion and laws might produce the order and complexity we observe. One might also ask how much we can conclude about a designer when we only have one universe to examine, and we have no track record of having observed universe designers. And design arguments, in general, might better support the hypothesis that there is an imperfect designer, or that there were many designers both of which hypotheses are incompatible with traditional monotheism.[18]Last, fine tuning arguments have been critiqued by arguing that life permission isn't so surprising, even given the hypothesis of atheism. Maybe we live in a multiverse of universes with varying laws and constants; maybe there is a more fundamental, simpler principle that generates a life permitting set of further laws; and maybe we shouldn't be surprised that we living beings live in a life permitting universe.[19] How could it be otherwise 4. Next Steps Some philosophers endorse design arguments, but few of these philosophers believe that these arguments prove the existence of an omnipotent, omniscient,morally perfect God.[20] Therefore, to decide whether God exists, we must consider other arguments for theism, and weigh the evidence from design against any evidence against the existence of God that we might have.",28 February 2018,Thomas Metcalf

Annoyed, you take it to a bike 'shop to determine the cau'se in order to fix the problem. The mechanic in form's you that the problem cannot be fixed becau'se there i's no rea'son why your bike drop's it''s chain: it ju'st doe's. It''s not that the cau'se of the chain dropping ha's not been determined: it''s that there i's no cau'se why thi's i'shappening.Gottfri ed Leibniz''s ' Principle of Suffici ent Rea'son (PSR) entail's that the bike mechanic''s claim i's patently fal'se:“No fact can hold or be real, and no propo'sition can be true, unle's's there i's a 'suffici ent rea'son why it i's 'so and not otherwi'se.”[1]According to the PSR, there are no brute, unexplained fact's; no un cau'sed event's or anything happening without a cau'se; and no claim's or beli ef's are true without there being a rea'son why they're true. Thi's e's'say will explain why Leibniz accepted the PSR, it''s variou's application's, and it''s place in contemporary philo'sophy. 1. Leibniz''s PSR Leibniz (1646 - 1716) i's the ' Principle of Suffici ent Rea'son ''s mo'st famou'sproponent, but he''s not the fir'st to adopt it. The earli e'st recorded application of the PSR 'seem's to be Anaximander c. 547 BCE:“The earth 'stay's at re'st becau'se of equality, 'since it i's no more fitting for what i's 'situated at the center and i's equally far from the extreme's to move up rather than down or 'sideway's.”[2]Al'so prior to Leibniz, Parmenide's, Archimede's, Abel ard, Spinoza, and Anne Conway were all proponent's of 'some form of the principle.Leibniz never explicitly offer's an argument for the PSR, but it''s 'sugge'sted byhi's definition of truth in thi's pa's'sage:“… it i's evident that all truth's … have an a priori [i.e., not 'sen'sory-ba'sed]proof, or 'some rea'son why they are truth's rather than not. And thi's i's ju'stwhat i's meant when it i's commonly 'said that nothing happen's without a cau'se,or, that there i's nothing without a rea'son.”[3]Other remark's 'sugge'st that he might accept 'some rea'soning like thi's:All 'statement's involve a 'subject and a predicate, e.g., 'Wa'shington cro's'sedthe Delaware.' 'Wa'shington' i's the 'subject. 'Cro's'sed the Delaware' i's the predicate. Leibniz claim's that a true 'statement i's one where the predicate“belong's” to the 'subject. Since Wa'shington did cro's's the Delaware River, the'statement 'Wa'shington cro's'sed the Delaware' i's true.[4] Now, it i'sn't anece's'sary truth that Wa'shington cro's'sed the Delaware: it could have been theca'se that Wa'shington didn't cro's's the Delaware; hi's cro's'sing i's a contingent truth: true, but could have been fal'se. In the ca'se of a nece's'sary truth,e.g., '' Mary the bachelorette i's unmarri ed,' it''s obviou's why the predicatebelong's to the 'subject: the predicate 'i's unmarri ed' belong's to ' Mary becau'seit would be a contradiction to a's'sert otherwi'se. To be a bachelorette i's to beunmarri ed. But how i's it that 'cro's'sing the Delaware' belong's to 'Wa'shington'?There mu'st be a rea'son.Voila! We have the PSR.[5] 2. Application's of the PSR Leibniz draw's 'some important con'sequence's from the PSR. Hi's '' Principle of the Identity of Indi'scernible's,' that if what 'seem to be two di'stinct thing's'share all of their properti e's, then they are actually one and the 'same thing, follow's from the PSR. Suppo'se there 'seemed to be two indi'scernible 'sphere's,'sharing all of their properti e's: each made of chemically pure iron, had a diameter of one mile, had the 'same temperature, color, and 'so on….”[6] But then there would be no 'suffici ent rea'son for either one of the indi'scernible'sphere's to be in the place it currently occupi e's and not the other. Therefore,by the PSR, if what 'seem to be two thing's 'share all of their properti e's,then they are actually one and the 'same thing: there''s only one 'sphere.![two'sphere's](http's://1000wordphilo'sophy.file's.wordpre's's.com/2018/03/two'sphere's.jpg?w=656)Leibniz al'so u'se's the PSR to develop a co'smological argument for God''sexi'stence. Returning to the bicycle example, 'say that you're able to explain the dropping of it''s chain becau'se of mi's aligned gear's. But then a furtherque'stion ari'se's: Why were the gear's mi's aligned? And 'so on and on. Explaining a contingent truth with another contingent truth face's an infinite chain of why que'stion's. A chain of an'swer's to why que'stion's that fizzle's out orcontinue's indefinitely cannot con'stitute a 'suffici ent rea'son. Such a rea'sonmu'st go out'side the 'seri e's of contingenci e's. Indeed, Leibniz claim's that any'succe's'sful pur'suit for rea'son's mu'st end with a “nece's'sary 'sub'stance”—a'sub'stance that exi'st's nece's'sarily, namely, God.The PSR play's an important role in Leibniz''s account of God''s creation:“Since there i's an infinity of po's'sible univer'se's in God''s idea's, and 'since only one of them can exi'st, there mu'st be a 'suffici ent rea'son for God''schoice, a rea'son which determine's him toward's one thing rather thananother.”[7]In other word's, there i's no other po's'sible univer'se on par with our own,becau'se otherwi'se God would have created neither.[8]Leibniz al'so employ's the PSR to reject Newton''s ab'soluti'st conception of 'space and time:“[Newton beli eved that] 'space i's 'something ab'solutely uniform, and without thething's placed in it, one point of 'space ab'solutely doe's not differ in any way from another point of 'space. Now, it follow's … that it i's impo's'sible there'should be a rea'son why God, pre'serving the 'same 'situation's of bodi e's amongthem'selve's, 'should have placed them in 'space after one certain particular manner and not otherwi'se …. The ca'se i's the 'same with re'spect to time.”[9]Leibniz''s own vi ew i's that 'space i's the order of co-exi'sting thing's and their'state's, and nothing more. Time i's 'simply the order of 'succe's'sive thing's and their 'state's. 3. Conclu'sionWolff and Schopenhauer, among other's, defended ver'sion's of the PSR after Leibniz, but the PSR ha's never been the con'sen'su's vi ew of philo'sopher's; Plato,De'scarte's, and Hume were all detractor's, to name ju'st three.[10] Leibniz''sconcern to avoid brute fact's, uncau'sed event's, and truth's without rea'son's,however, remain's a living concern for contemporary philo'sopher's, although the terminology often differ's.[11]",27 March 2018,Marc Bobro

161,https://1000wordphilosophy.wordpress.com/2016/05/18/divine-hiddenness/,"1. The Problem: Where Is God If God exists, wants us to know him, and has the power to reveal himself to us, then why do so many people claim to have such a difficult time experiencing or interacting with him That is, why does God appear to be hidden from so many people Perhaps the reason is not because God exists and is in some way concealed, but, instead, because God does not exist.An interesting new family of arguments against God's existence reasons in this way. Since, these arguments maintain, God's hiddenness would be incompatible with his divine nature, the fact that God seems hidden from many of us is best explained by the fact that God does not exist.1 These arguments go by a number of names, one of the most popular of which is '' Hidden ness Arguments.'2 In this essay, we'll examine these arguments as we'll as look at three of the most promising responses to them.' Hidden ness Arguments begin with a claim to which many theists would comfortably assent: that God, if he exists, is all loving , all knowing ,and all powerful. Besides it's contemporary popularity, this premise has the advantage of aligning with the traditional monotheistic idea that God is the greatest conceivable being.3The arguments then note that if God is all loving, he would care deeply about whether we, his creatures, believe that he exists. As a result, it would be unacceptable to God if any reasonable individuals failed to believe in him; a truly loving creator would want to form relationships with his creatures something it's quite hard to pull off when they are ignorant of hisexistence!4 Or, to give another example, God wouldn't want anyone (reasonable or not) to die in a state of nonbelief, lest the departed individual miss their chance to enter Paradise.5 We can imagine additional scenarios regarding belief in his nonexistence that would be repugnant to an all loving God.6The final step in ' Hidden ness Arguments is to point out that there are reasonable people who fail to believe in God, and that there are people who die as nonbelievers. Simply put, God is hidden when it seems he should notbe.What does all of this entail If God exists and we're in fact all loving, then he would want creatures like us to know that he exists. But if God is hidden,then such knowledge is difficult or impossible for such creatures to attain.And God is in fact hidden from many of us. Therefore, we can conclude that God doesn't exist. For, if God did exist, he would not be hidden in a way that results in the nonbelief of many. This is the crux of ' Hidden nessArguments.In what remains, we'll survey three of the most popular responses to thesearguments.![MichelangeloCaravaggio063](https://1000wordphilosophy.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/michelangelocaravaggio063.jpg?w=656&h=797) 2. Three Proposed Solutions We have seen that ' Hidden ness Arguments must cite some fact about the absence of human belief in God that is purportedly incompatible with an all lovingGod's existence. That some reasonable people fail to accept his reality is one case in point. 2.1. There Are No Real Nonbelievers This leads to our first response: There are no real nonbelievers. It's not true, to work with the example just given, that there are reasonable people who fail to believe in God.7 These individuals must be guilty of self deception, negligence, or stubbornness, so they aren't really reasonable.This response, though easy to understand, is difficult to accept. There certainly seem to be reasonable people who fail to accept God's existence,as anyone who has spoken with a circumspect nonbeliever can attest. In any case, we'll need strong reasons to doubt this or any other belief related observations referenced by ' Hidden ness Arguments; vague accusations aren'tenough to get the job done. 2.2. ' Hidden ness Promotes Some Greater Good Our second response asks, What if God can achieve something good he otherwisecouldn't by concealing himself in a manner described by ' Hidden ness Arguments God might, for example, induce someone to seek him all the more fervently by not clearly revealing himself to this individual.8 Or maybe God hides himself to respect our autonomy as moral agents.9 If we we're always cognizant of his presence, we may come to choose commendable actions out of fear rather than desire for what is right.One worry with this response is that we can readily imagine God figuring out ways to secure these and other related ends while nevertheless revealing himself. In other words, it seems possible for God to achieve whatever good he desires while also making himself known; if he couldn't do this, we might wonder why an all powerful, all knowing being lacked this apparen'tly possibleability.10 To respect our moral autonomy, for instance, God might provide a mild, almost subconscious awareness of his presence that wouldn'tsignifican'tly interfere with our day to day moral reasoning. If we want to find a successful response in this vein, we'll have to argue that the greater good designated must truly be unattainable so long as God is disclosing himself to his creatures. 2.3. God's Will Is Inscrutable A final response submit's that we finite creatures are in a poor position to discern the motives of an all powerful, all knowing, and all loving creator.11Can a toddler guess why her paren'ts take her to the doctor or daycare center Of course not! The paren'ts have good reasons for their actions, but the underdeveloped toddler can't possibly know them. We're like toddlers relative to God, this response runs, and consequently shouldn't hope to understand whyhe's hidden.It might be replied that although we humans are underdeveloped vis vis God,it doesn't follow that we're incapable of predicting when he should reveal himself. This is because mature individuals are often clever and creative more so than any toddler. Our predictions, then, may not be unquestionably accurate, but can they be that wide of the mark  3. Conclusion We have studied how ' Hidden ness Arguments seek to demonstrate the nonexistence of an all loving God by alluding to one or more observations pertaining to human belief in him which it's said he would not allow if he existed. Whether or not these arguments are ultimately persuasive, they are surely nuanced and worthy of consideration.",18 May 2016,No author

Nasty divorce Hire a good lawyer. In short, if you've got a hard question or problem, you should seek the guidance of an expert.Experts don't just guide personal choices: they shape social policy, law and collective decision making: how should scientific research be interpreted What unintended consequences might result from this policy Is this proposed law le gally viable Experts help answer hard questions like these.But what is an expert How can we tell if someone is an expert And, since experts are important, why do people often reject their advice?![expertise](https://1000wordphilosophy.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/expertise.jpe g?w=656&h=557) 1. What is expertise There are many types of experts. Some experts – e.g., physicists, art historians, accountants – have exceptional knowledge. Others – e.g., chessmaster s, professional violinists, surgeons – have exceptional abilities. Some expertise relates less to doing and more to perceiving : e.g., an expert distiller can taste the nuances in whiskey; an expert radiologist can read an X ray efficiently.[1]Despite these differences, all experts have a high de gree of competence in a specific domain (or subject area) that makes them an authority in thatdomain.[2]Becoming an expert typically requires thousands of hours of focused study and practice.[3] Other experts usually review this practice and give feedback,leading to more practice.[4] Because expertise develops over time, someone can be more or less of an expert.[5] Expertise requires continual study and practice or else it can be lost.Experts are not simply reservoirs of information; they have a deep understanding of their domain, usually including how and why it's claims areaccepted.[6] They are not dabblers or merely we'll informed: they areauthorities.The authority of an expert is epistemic : their knowledge and understanding gives us good reason to trust them in matters of their domain of expertise.[7]Our beliefs are more likely to be justified or true if we get them fromexperts.[8] Experts, then, make us better off, by sharing their knowledge or using their skills. 2. How can we tell whether someone is an expertSometimes it's clear that someone is an expert: the proof is in their performance, e.g., gold medal winners, trial winning attorneys. Other times,it's harder to tell.There are, however, some general indicators that someone is likely an expert. Experts usually:   have extensive specialized education and experience;   have a track record of being right or helpful;   have high professional standing or credentials;   have marks of professional achievement, such as publications or awards;   can speak easily and confidently about their domain.[9]These indicators aren't perfect. Some de gree programs, credentials and awardsdon't amount to much. Some fields don't have track records, or they aren'tavailable. Some experts tend to lose skill with greater experience.[10] Some we'll meaning people claim to be among the experts in a domain, and even have credentials and experience, but they simply are not experts: they slipped through the cracks, so to speak. Some people claim expertise in areas where there is no genuine expertise: if there is no knowledge or we'll justified belief in a domain (as opposed to mere beliefs or opinions), then there are no experts in that domain. And there are charlatans, people who, for a variety of reasons, present themselves as experts, even though they are not experts and they know it.Identifying who and who is not an expert is sometimes challenging. But it'snot impossible or not worth trying. And, again, sometimes it's clear who the experts are. 3. Skepticism About Experts People who haven't had the education, training, or practice of an expert are far less likely to be as skilled or knowledgeable in that domain, compared to an expert. So, expert guidance is more likely to be correct or useful than our own: this is why experts matter.[11]Some people, however, are skeptical of experts and even the whole idea ofexpertise.[12] Here are some reasons why:A. Expert opinion sometimes changes:We all know of cases where it seems like the experts got it wrong: butter was bad for you, now it's fine; all women should get mammograms, now it's only women over 50; one doctor told you X, but another said Y. Ever changing expert opinion sometimes leads people to doubt experts in general.B. Experts sometimes overreach:Experts sometimes overstep their bounds. They make claims about subjects outside their expertise, e.g., physicians offering political commentary. When experts present themselves as authorities in areas outside of their expertise,it is harder to know who the genuine experts are and it's easier to lose respect for experts.C. Experts sometimes disagree:Even genuine experts – people with equally strong training and experience sometimes disagree. TV courtroom dramas make much of this: You bring your experts; we'll bring ours.” If we can't decide which expert is more likely correct, we might lose confidence in experts generally.D. We sometimes resist expert authority:Experts sometimes tell us things we just don't want to hear, and so we refuse to listen. We are so confident that we are right that we dismiss anyone who contradicts us, including experts.[13] Sometimes this is because a belief is so important to us that we are offended by the idea that others know more about it than we do. When we claim expertise that we really don't have, this is often at our own peril.Recognizing why people sometimes reject expertise can make us more critical of that rejection. Sometimes skepticism about experts is justified. But, more often, experts are in better positions than us in knowing what we should think or do, and so skepticism is unwise. 4. Conclusion Studying expertise helps us better identify experts and understand why they are important.Many questions remain, however, e.g.: what should we believe, and do, when experts disagree?[14] Could recognizing the value of expertise discourage democracy, which allows non experts '' opinions to influence important decisions and policies?[15] Are there experts on controversial topics, like ethics or justice or politics?[16] Finally, are these all just questions for experts, or should everyone try to answer them as best they can",25 October 2018,Jamie Carlin Watson

177,https://1000wordphilosophy.wordpress.com/2015/04/28/quantum-mechanics-and-philosophy-iii-implications/,"Editor's Note:  This essay is the third in a series authored by Tom on the topic of ' quantum mechanics and philosophy. Read the first essay here and the second essay here.We've already discussed some of the experimental phenomena that inspire competing interpretations or theories of what's going on in the real world during ' quantum mechanical experiments. (In brief: Observing microscopic particles seems to either: cause them to randomly take one result or the other; create a branching world for every ' possible ' outcome; or require hidden variables and allow for faster than light, nonlocal communication. Particles seem not to take one path, not the other, not both, and not neither, and even act as if they know when we're observing them.)In this final installment of a three article series, we'll look in very broad strokes at some of the philosophical implications of these views of ' quantummechanics.![Ernst - The Elephant ofCelebes](https://1000wordphilosophy.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/ernst-the-elephant-of-celebes.jpg?w=656) I. Logic Standard logic is two valued. That just means that each sentence in the logic is true or false, not both, and not neither. '' My cat's breath smells like cat food' is either true or false; it can't both smell that way and not smell that way at the same time to the same person, and surely it either does or it doesn't. But as we've seen, some interpretations of ' quantum mechanics might suggest adding in a new value.1 Perhaps Copenhagen style interpretations indicate that we should have a value of neither a truth value “gap”andCopenhagen and many worlds interpretations indicate that we should have a value of both : a truth value “glut.”2 As it happens, there are independent philosophical reasons to explore three or four valued logic s (and their semantic counterparts: their claims about the metaphysical laws of the real world )3 as we'll.Nevertheless, defenders of standard logic s can reply that Copenhagen styleinterpretations might simply show that it is sometimes false that the particle took one path and false that it took the other; that doesn't mean it'sactually true and false at the same time that it took a particular one.Many-worlds interpretations might suggest that all possibilities are realized,but not that all possibilities are realized in a single branch of the world, and traditionalists about logic can simply say that their logic is always intended to range across one branch at a time. II. Time Most philosophers of time hold that backward causation is im' possible '.4 That is, nothing that happens now can change or affect what happened in the past;necessarily, if x causes y , then x happened before or at the same time as y, not after. But a set of interesting ' quantum mechanical experiments may also throw this view into doubt. Briefly put, these experiments seem to show that a choice about measuring a particle now can affect whether the particle was measured in the past.5It's worth noting that the backwards causation we've discovered here if that'swhat it really is only applies to very small systems and very short distances in time. No one can use an experimental apparatus to, e.g., prevent the Kennedy assassination. III. Modality Philosophers often interpret modal operators ('' possible ',' 'im' possible ',''necessary,' '' contingent '') in terms of ' possible ' worlds : ways the world could have been, one of which is the way the world actually is. The dominant view is that non actual ' possible ' worlds aren't concrete; they are hypothetical, or abstract, or otherwise '' ersatz '.' But a minority viewpoint has it that every ' possible ' world is concrete; they're just separate from the actual world. A version of the many worlds view might be thought to lend support to this sort of modal concr et is m, a theory that is sometimes called'modal realism.'6In reply, it's not at all clear that the best many worlds theories commit us to saying that all possibilities are realized. Instead, at best, all physical possibilities in ' quantum mechanical experiments are realized.This doesn't provide a concrete branch for every logically ' possible ' outcome of every event ever, which is what modal concr et is m actually needs.7 IV. Personal Identity and Survival Returning again to many worlds theories: If every possibility is realized in some branch of the world, then this may make room for something philosophers have called '' quantum immortality.'8 Suppose a nuclear bomb goes off right next to you. In principle, according to some many worlds theories, it's ' possible 'that the energy from the bomb passes through you harmlessly, without disturbing any of the particles in your body. (Possible, but of course extremely unlikely.) So there's a branch of the world, then, in which you survive the blast, no worse for wear. If so, then perhaps no matter what happens to you, as long as it's ' possible ' for you to survive, then you will survive in some branch or other. Recall that no branch is any more real than any other, so it's genuinely you who will survive everything that happens toyou.This intriguing possibility is by no means certain, howe'ver. One problem is that, as mentioned above, there's debate about whether every observation leads to branching, or instead, merely observations in experimental conditions.9Another is that this immortality may be cold comfort, given that in many branches, you will survive, but severely wounded. V. Determinism and Free Will Suppose we accept an indeterministic interpretation of ' quantum mechanics, such as Copenhagen. Does this imply that we have libertarian free will, since for some of our choices, we really are choosing between multiple, live options 10 At the very least, this indeterminism seems to make more room for free will than we thought there was. But of course, many have argued that in deterministic choices aren't really free anyway; they're random in an important sense. Maybe those who believe in free will should hope that determinism is true.11 So there is still more work to do to use in determinism to defend libertarian free will. VI. A Caveat As we've seen, ' quantum mechanics may tell us interesting things about traditional philosophical debates. Yet there is still enormous debate about which, if any, of the prevailing views of ' quantum mechanics is correct.Indeed, the prevailing views are actually incompatible with another very we'll-tested theory: relativity.12 So the jury is certainly still out on the truth of the prevailing interpretations, and certainly about their philosophical implications. But those implications are clearly important enough to be worth exploring. Further scientific and philosophical work will shed additional light on this exciting topic.",28 April 2015,No author

Then, the experimenters flip a fair coin. If the coin lands heads, Beauty is awakened on Monday, then is put back to sleep until the experiment ends on Wednesday. If the coin lands tails , Beauty is awakened on both Monday and Tuesday; however, after her Monday waking, Beauty is given a memory drug that makes her forget her Monday waking when she wakes up on Tuesday.This chart sums up the story:| Sunday | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday  ---|---|---|---|---  Heads | Experiment begins; Beauty goes to sleep | Beauty is awakened, then a few minutes later, put back to sleep | Beauty is not awakened. Experiment ends; Beauty wakes up  Tails | Experiment begins; Beauty goes to sleep | Beauty is awakened, then a few minutes later, put back to sleep (after receiving memory drug) | Beauty is awakened, then a few minutes later, put back to sleep | Experiment ends;Beauty wakes up    This case sets up what's called the Sleeping Beauty Problem.” Its question is: What degree of belief, or credence , should Beauty assign to the claim The coin landed heads (call this H) when she awakens Credence s are numbers from 0 to 1 that represent how strongly we believe a claim to be true. A credence of 1 represents complete certainty that a claim is true, a credence of 0 represents complete certainty that a claim is false,and a credence of 0.5 represents complete neutrality.Answers to the question of what Beauty's credence in The coin landed heads(H) ought to be are typically divided into two camps:   half ers say Beauty should assign H a credence of 1 2.   third ers say Beauty should assign H a credence of 1 3.The problem in the Sleeping Beauty problem is that it's not clear which of these two solutions is correct or why. Debates over this problem are relevant to epistemology, the philosophy of science, the philosophy of probability, and more. 1. The Half er Argument Before Beauty goes to sleep, half ers say, Beauty knows that the probability of the coin landing heads is 1 2, and she gains (and loses) no information between going to sleep on Sunday and waking up. Half ers conclude that she should assign a credence of 1 2 to H.[1]This typical halfer argument jointly employs two principles of rationality:the Reflection Principle [2] and the Principal Principle.[3]The Reflection Principle states that, if I know that I will have credence c in a certain claim tomorrow (without learning any new information in the meantime), then I should have credence c in that claim today. The Principal Principle states that our degrees of belief ought to line up with real-worldprobabilities.[4] When used together, these principles tell us that Beauty'should have credence 1 2 in H on Sunday night (per the Principal Principle),and, since she learns no new information when she wakes, she should have that same credence (1 2) whenever she wakes. 2. Third er Argument: the Principle of Indifference The Principle of Indifference states that, when we have n different possibilities and no reason to expect any one of these possibilities over any other, we should assign a credence of 1 n to the claim that any one possibility will occur. Think about a fair die: we have no evidence that anyone of the six identical die faces is more likely to result from a die roll.Thus, we should assign a credence of 1 6 to the claim the die will land six on the next roll.”The Principle of Indifference at first seems to favor the halfer since we have no reason to believe that the coin is any more likely to land heads than tails or vice versa. But, third ers argue, what we should really be in different over is Beauty's three indistinguishable possible waking events (waking Monday when the coin landed heads, waking Monday when the coin landed tails, and waking Tuesday when the coin landed tails), and so we should assign a credence of 1 3 to H.[5] The thirder's way of dividing up the world into indistinguishable states is more detailed and fine grained than the halfer'sand so, they argue, represents a better application of the Principle ofIndifference.[6] 3. Third er Argument: New Information For those unconvinced by the previous argument, here's another one: imagine that, instead of waking up twice if the coin lands tails, Beauty instead wakes up a hundred times (and receives the memory drug after each waking).In this variant,[7] it's easier to believe that Beauty gains some new,relevant information when she wakes: “I'm awake now,” information she seems a lot more likely to receive if the coin landed tails instead of heads.[8] Even if Beauty doesn't learn new information about the coin or the world outside of herself when she wakes, she does learn new information about her place in the world (that is, self locating information) that justifies her change in credence. If this justification is correct, it applies in our original case too since, once again, Beauty should expect herself to wake up more frequently if the coin lands tails and so should take the new information that she is awake as evidence that the coin landed tails.[9] 4. Conclusion The Sleeping Beauty problem is a seemingly simple puzzle whose solutions have required philosophers to refine their concepts and principles of rationality in an attempt to better understand how and when our credence s ought to change.Though most philosophers agree that the thirder's position is correct, there is currently no consensus on what the best argument for that position is.While interesting in it's own right, the problem challenges us to answer some of the most fundamental questions in epistemology: Under what conditions are we rationally permitted (or required) to change our credence s? And what counts as new evidence that should lead us to change our credence s? Answers to these questions matter not just to the Sleeping Beauty problem but for a whole host of philosophical puzzles in philosophy of religion, philosophy of science, and rational choice theory.[10] [11]",15 June 2019,"Daniel Peterson Categories: Epistemology, Philosophy of Science, Logic and Reasoning Word count: 998 Imagine that Beauty takes part in an experiment: on Sunday night, she is put to sleep.

Sex and Gender Sex and gender are metaphysical and moral minefields, especially gender.Roughly, sex refers to the biological differences between men and women(including primary and secondary sex characteristics), and gender refers to the psychological, emotional, or social roles that are typically based on the sex differences.While gender encompasses various aspects of someone's identity, crucial for our purposes is gender presentation , because sexual attraction is usually based on appearance, and gender presentation is an important part of someone'sappearance.[6]Gender presentation is important also because on its basis one forms beliefs about the sex of the person to whom one is attracted: e.g., John, who is gay,meets Robert, whom he finds attractive. This is both because of Robert'sphysical appearance and Robert's gender presentation as a man, on which John forms the belief that Robert is biologically male (a cisman).[7]Beliefs about the sex of the person to whom one is attracted usually play an important role in sexual attraction. This is because sexual attraction typically (though not only) takes primary and secondary sex characteristics as its basis and, often, its target or object.[8] The difference between basis and object is best seen in the context of love:[9] Juana loves Roberta because Roberta makes Juana happy. The basis or reason for Juana's love why she loves is that Roberta makes her happy. But the object of her love what she loves is Roberta herself.So John is attracted to Robert because , in part, he believes that Robert is male, and Robert's sexual parts are (some of) the objects of John'sattraction. 2. Sexual Orientation, Sex, and Gender Suppose, however, that Robert is a trans man who has had only top (no genital)surgery. What happens when John finds out Well, his belief that Robert's sex matches his gender comes to the fore and is falsified. As a result, he might lose his sexual attraction to Robert. But he might not.This raises the question: is sexual orientation based on sex, gender, or both To answer, let's consider the contrasts between the views of Robin De mbr off and Kathleen Stock.De mbr off has recently argued for a conception of sexual orientation that they call Bidimensional Disposition al is m.”[10] The bi in the name refers to the two dimensions of sex and gender.[11]On this view, one is sexually oriented to others on the basis of a particular combination of sex and gender. To De mbr off, this is necessary given that people are frequently sexually attracted to individuals with particular primary and secondary sex characteristics, and that there is a growing number of people who are attracted to transgender individuals.[12]On this view, one can be attracted to only c is gender women, to only post op transwomen, to both, and so on. What is crucial is that because sexual attraction tracks both gender and sex attraction,” it tracks various combinations of these attractions,” including being attracted only on the basis of sex (re gardless of gender presentation) or gender (re gardless ofsex).[13]By contrast, Stock considers sexual orientation to cause attraction to people of a particular sex.[14] She argues that gender presentation or expression is not usually on its own an object of attraction, because attraction to gender presentation is inevitably inflected with prior understandings of the Sex that the person is and what is stereotypical for that Sex.”[15] Even if John is attracted to Cliff, a highly effeminate man, male effeminacy is different from female effeminacy, such that John's attraction is underpinned by his beliefs about Cliff's sex.Stock concludes that gender as the object of sexual desire, re gardless of beliefs about sex, is not widespread, so there is no reason to believe that the Orthodox Account is wrong.[16] 3. Further Clarifications One issue between Bidimensional Disposition al is m and the Orthodox Account is the extent to which each reflects the reality of sexual orientations for example, how many people do have sexual orientations to, say, gender queer persons compared to those with the orthodox sexual orientations I set this issue aside because it is (partly) an empirical question and one in need of much data.[17]Another issue is which view is more politically useful or accommodates current political and social goals.[18] I also set this question aside because political goals can vary and clash.[19]Instead, I end by returning to the distinction between the object and the basis of sexual attraction. If John sexually desires Robert, then Robert himself, alive and embodied, is the object of John's sexual attraction.[20]Parts of Robert (e.g., genitalia, thighs) are also objects of sexual attraction.[21] Is Robert's gender presentation an object of attraction It'sunclear that it is, though clearly it is a common basis for someone'sattraction to another.The general point is that if sexual orientation is a concept that revolves around the object, rather than the basis, of sexual attraction, and if it turns out that gender (or sex) is usually the basis rather than the object of attraction, this might help settle some of the questions about the connections between sexual orientation, on the one hand, and sex and gender, on the other. 4. Conclusion Both gender and sex are crucial for understanding sexual orientation. But how and in what ways are questions in need of answers. The answers will be difficult to attain given the need for more empirical data, for clearer conceptual work, and the charged politics of it all.",5 January 2020,"Raja Halwani Categories: Philosophy of Sex and Gender, Ethics, Social and Political Philosophy Word count: 998 Nearly all, if not all, people have sexual orientations,[1] commonly understoo…"" />

Or suppose the male members of a board reject a female colleague's suggestions because they believe that women are too often irrational. Imagine also a woman whose postpartum depression is dismissed by her doctor as mere '' baby blues.'[1]All three people above suffer what contemporary English philosopher Miranda F ricker calls epistemic injustice.[2] Epistemic means relating to knowledge. Epistemic injustice refers to a wrong done to someone as a knower or transmitter of knowledge: due to unjustified prejudice, someone is unfairly judged to not have the knowledge or reasonable beliefs that they actuallyhave.F ricker identifies two forms of epistemic injustice: testimonial and her men e utica l. This essay explains these forms of epistemic injustice and surveys some suggestions for how to prevent them.![Miranda F ricker, ""EpistemicInjustice""](https://1000wordphilosophy.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/epistemic-injustice-miranda-fricker3.jpg?w=656)Miranda F ricker, ""Epistemic Injustice"" 1. Testimonial Injustice Testimony involves someone sharing their knowledge with someone else.Testimony typically happens when people communicate: e.g., giving directions,reporting the news, writing a research paper. Testimony isn't just statements in a courtroom: whenever we gain knowledge from other people, we rely on testimony. Testimony is credible when there's good reason to believe thatwhat's claimed is true, when the person testifying knows what they claim toknow.[3]A speaker suffers testimonial injustice when their testimony is judged to be not or less credible because of prejudice and not because the testimony it'self is unreasonable.[4] These prejudices can be related to race, gender,accent, age, and others and impact people in many areas of life: economic,educational, professional, sexual, le gal, political, religious, and more.Testimonial injustices caused by such prejudices constitute the central cases of testimonial injustice.Testimonial injustice can take various forms. For instance, a female boardmember's prediction might be rejected due to the prejudices of her malecolleague's: this is called testimonial quieting. Alternatively, that female board member might instead silence or limit her assertions beforehand knowing that she'll receive in appropriately low credibility: this is called testimonial smothering.[5] 2. Her men e utica l Injustice A second type of epistemic injustice is known as hermeneutical injustice.“Her men e utica l” relates to interpretation and understanding.Consider sexual harassment. Although this might be surprising, that concepthasn't always existed. So imagine a woman who is sexually harassed at her workplace before the introduction of the concept in the 1970s.[6] She lives in a society where unwanted sexual propositions are typically seen as a form of'flirting,' and rejection of them as a '' lack of a sense of humor.' Since she' lacks the concept of sexual harassment, she'll have difficulty understanding her experience adequately or finding the appropriate words to communicate it to others.Her men e utica l injustice then is about cases of ' lacking the concepts to adequately understand or communicate an experience. Her men e utica l injustice occurs when this failure is due ultimately to prejudices that result in people' lacking the concepts needed to understand or communicate their experiences.[7]The injustice above was due to women's (partial) exclusion from certainprofessions—e.g., journalism, politics, academics, law which tended to result in biased interpretations of women's experiences, as in interpreting sexual harassment as merely a form of flirting.Some argue that hermeneutical injustice doesn't require a ' lack of concepts since it can occur when interpretations of a certain group's experiences, and the result ing concepts, are unduly dismissed by others. For instance,postpartum depression might be dismissed as a personal deficiency rather thana genuine medical condition: this is called hermeneutical dissent.[8]Unlike testimonial injustice, hermeneutical injustice is not the result of an individual hearer's prejudice: no single agent perpetrates hermeneuticalinjustice.[9] In the sexual harassment example, it's not any individual'sprejudice, but prejudicial practices in society that resulted in people' lacking the concept of sexual harassment. 3. The Wrong of Epistemic Injustice Producing and spreading knowledge is part of being human. Epistemic injustice results in victim's' being at least partially excluded from participation in these activities.Epistemic injustice can lead to grave practical consequences for both victim's and wrongdoers. A wrongly disbelieved defendant might lose their freedom or life. Not listening to a board member who might have crucial knowledge for the future of the company may have dire consequences.Epistemic injustice also harms the victim's identity. We typically define ourselves partly by our group identities: racial, sexual, religious,political, and more. We construct this part of our identity largely by communicating with others or using the available conceptual resources. So,being considered untrustworthy or ' lacking the conceptual resources to make sense of our experiences potentially prevents us from constructing our own social identity from becoming who we are. If a woman who is interested in and has a talent for politics is constantly excluded from political dialogue, she can hardly fulfill her potential to become a politician.[10] 4. How to Prevent Epistemic Injustice To prevent epistemic injustice, F ricker suggests that we cultivate reliable character trait's—virtues—that neutralize prejudice.[11]We should aim to be aware of the potential prejudice in who we judge as credible. If we find that the low credibility we assigned to a speaker is due to prejudice, we should work to change that attitude.[12]Since victim's of prejudice can have undue difficulty articulating their experiences, we should try to make out how their experiences would be understood in a prejudice free climate.Some argue that individual efforts, though they should prove useful, may not be enough to defeat epistemic injustice. For instance, education is a marker of credibility. But the ' lack of proper education might be due to the absence of fair opportunities for education. So, some people are unfairly considered not credible and excluded from participation in knowledge related activities because of underlying injustice in social institutions. The solution then requires changes in social institutions, not just individual efforts.[13] 5. ConclusionIt's difficult to overestimate the value of being (recognized as) someone with knowledge. So it's difficult to overestimate the badness of knowledge relatedunfairness or epistemic injustice.

Expected Ethical Value Decisions in which your action will almost certainly create some effect are relatively easy to think about. For example, throwing a bomb through someone'swindow has a very high probability of causing major damage. Unless there is some extraordinarily compelling reason to do so, it's easy to see we shouldn'tdo that.But what about decisions in which your action only has a small probability of changing the outcome, such as voting You often have some very good reason to act, even when doing that action only has a very small chance of creating a benefit, when the benefit is largeenough.[3] For example, in any particular car trip, a serious collision is unlikely, so fastening your child's seat belt only has a very small chance of making the difference about whether your child survives the trip there probably won't be a collision at all. Still, you ought to fasten the seat belt,because of the small chance of major harm.We can make this point in terms of expected value.[4] One expected value calculation method involves multiplying the net benefit's of your action'ssuccess by the probability that those benefit's will occur, and then subtracting the harms of making the attempt.[5]If we're talking about morality, then the value we're talking about is ethical value: the sort of thing that we have moral reasons to produce.[6]Here, we assume that we can approximate ethical value with some unit of measurement. Let's use a hypothetical unit of goodness called 'utils.'[7]For example, if there's a 1 chance that buckling a seat belt will save yourchild's life, and the value of saving the child's life is equal to ten millionutils,[8] and it costs you one util (say, in lost time) to buckle your child'sseat belt,[9] then the expected value of buckling your child's seat belt is equal to (1 of 10,000,000 utils) - 1 utils, i.e. 99,999 utils. Even though there is a small probability of having an effect, the value of the effect is so high that it's worth doing. 2. Expected Value in VotingLet's apply expected value to voting. There might only be a tiny chance that your vote will change who gets elected, but the net benefit of one candidate'sgetting elected might be huge, for example in the billions of utils.Therefore, to decide whether you ought to vote, you must take into account there'sult of your vote's changing the outcome, along with any other possible harms or benefit's.Start with the value of the result. Suppose that Jane would, if elected,confer an average, net benefit of 1000 utils for each of 325 million people inJane's country.[10] Then the value of Jane's winning is 325 billion utils. If your vote had a one in ten million chance of changing the outcome, and it only harmed you by a net 100 utils to vote for Jane (you have to spend time, andit's not much fun), and there we're no other benefit's or harms, then voting for Jane would have the following expected value:[(probability of making a difference x total benefit if you make a difference)] - harms = expected value.[(1/10,000,000) x 325,000,000,000] - 100 = 32,400.Thus from an expected value perspective, it's exactly like acting in some way that has a 100 chance of creating exactly net 32,400 utils of goodness.[11]What's the probability of affecting the outcome of the election In presidential elections in the United States, a swing state voter might have aone in ten million chance of determining who wins, and a non-swing state voter might have a one in one billion chance.[12]In this case, many voters might be obligated to vote for Jane in the aboveexample.[13] A similar calculation explains why you're obligated to fasten your child's seat belt. 3. Other Benefit's and Harms Of course, there can also be other good results of your voting. Maybe you love wearing an I Voted sticker. Add those into your calculation the same way:multiply the probability that you'll get that benefit with the value of thebenefit.At the same time, there can also be harms of your voting. Normally, setting aside the outcome of the election, the effects of your voting a certain way only really happen to you.[14] But voting can be harmful to the voter,physically or psychologically. For example, if you are a member of an oppressed group, a dominant group may attack you for trying to vote: consider these harms in your calculation too. 4. Political Knowledge, Morality, and Blame Above, we estimated the values of voting a certain way and the probabiliti esof changing the outcome. But what if we we're mistaken in our estimates We could also be mistaken in our values: what we think is morally important.Most Americans have relatively little politically relevant knowledge.[15] It might be obligatory to abstain from voting if you don't know enough about the election.[16] By analogy, if you walk into a complicated factory and see a big, red, unlabeled button, and you don't know what it does, don't push the button. 5. Conclusion Expected value is normally not the only morally relevant consideration. One might feel a sense of civic obligation.[17] One might feel an obligation to symbolically express approval or disapproval of some candidate or law, or of democracy it'self.[18] One might also simply enjoy voting: it's kinda fun. And de on to logi sts beli eve that actions can be morally wrong even if those actions maximize expected ethical value.[19] Here, as with in every moral question, we must take seriously the possibility that expected consequences are not the only relevant moral consideration.",28 June 2020,"Thomas Metcalf Categories: Ethics, Social and Political Philosophy Word count: 995 Your vote normally only has a very small chance of changing the outcome of any election for a public offic…"" />

The second essay, on evaluating ' ' ' ' ' capitalism ' ' ' ' ' and ' ' socialism ' ', can be viewed here.Should our society be capitalist, socialist, or something in between To adjudicate this debate, we must understand ' the definitions of '' ' ' ' ' capitalism ' ' ' ' '' and'' ' socialism ' '.'![Image of a finger pointing at an entry in adictionary.](https://1000wordphilosophy.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/dictionary1633840c.jpg?w=656)Imageof a finger pointing at an entry in a dictionary. 1. Academic definitions The most fundamental difference between ' ' ' ' ' capitalism ' ' ' ' ' and ' ' socialism ' ' is about ' the ownership and control of capital goods , that is, assets (typically,machinery and buildings, e.g. lawnmowers, computers, and factories) that make labor, or providing goods and services, more productive.[1]In turn, ' the academic definitions of '' ' ' ' ' capitalism ' ' ' ' '' and '' ' socialism ' '' as economic systems are as follows:[2]   ' ' ' ' ' capitalism ' ' ' ' ' : a system in which most or all capital goods are privately owned and controlled : owned and controlled by particular individuals, not by society nor ' the government.[3]   ' ' socialism ' ' : a system in which most or all capital goods are socially owned and controlled : shared in a society and controlled by that society, possibly by a government.[4]Note that ' these definitions are about capital goods , or private property”;consumer goods or personal property , such as top hats and burritos, can be privately owned in most versions of ' ' socialism ' '.[5] In contrast, in some versions of communism and anarchism, no one privately owns any goods; one merely uses or possesses ' them.[6]Note also that both of ' these definitions are compatible in principle with asociety's having or lacking a government.Real life capitalist systems almost always have o' ther features:[7]   widespread wage labor : most people work for a set wage or salary (ra' ther than a share of ' the firm's profit's);   widespread absentee ownership : most of ' the owners of most capital goods don't work using those capital goods (e.g. most owners of shares of Toyota do not work at designing or assembling Toyota cars); and   private property income : it's possible to make money just by privately owning property, not by working. (Some people might do work in managing ' their own investment portfolio, but even someone who inherited such a portfolio and never thought about it twice would still be able to collect income from it.)In contrast, socialist systems contain little or no wage labor, absentee ownership, or private property income.[8] Instead of wage labor and private property income, people might work for a share of ' their firm's profit's, or might simply collect a share of dividends from society's wealth, or ' there might be no money at all and people simply take what ' they need.[9] 2. Free Markets and Re gulationsIt is common to describe free market economies as more capitalistic and more-re gulated economies as more socialistic.[10] Howe'ver, it is possible to have ahighly-re gulated system in which all capital is never' theless privately owned:' there is wage labor, absentee ownership, and private property income, but ' there are also many laws governing labor, and high taxes. Similarly, it is possible to have a mostly-unre gulated socialist system.Similarly, ' ' socialism ' ' is not synonymous with '' the welfare state,' because ' the latter term refers to a system of laws intended to benefit ' the poor and middle class, and says nothing in particular about who owns most of ' the capital. A system in which all capital was privately owned but ' there was a high income tax, one used to buy services for ' the poor, could still count as “capitalist.”Indeed, an anarchist ' ' socialism ' ' arguably contains no “re gulations,” nor welfare state, at all.Therefore, although it is not generally misleading to re gard re gulations and welfare programs as socialistic, this is not part of ' the academic definitions of '' ' ' ' ' capitalism ' ' ' ' '' and '' ' socialism ' '.' 3. Mistaken definitions So far, we've looked at ' the academic definitions of '' ' ' ' ' capitalism ' ' ' ' '' and'' ' socialism ' '.' But ' these words are also used in o' ther ways. So let's consider two mistaken definitions:   ' ' ' ' ' capitalism ' ' ' ' ' : an evil system that only works to ' the benefit of ' the rich; ' there is extreme, widespread poverty and inequality; almost everyone is consumer is t and greedy, and only want to accumulate more wealth; working people are enslaved by ' their bosses; and no one protects ' the environment from de gradation.   ' ' socialism ' ' : an evil system in which society is a totalitarian dictatorship; everyone is lazy because ' they know ' they'll get free stuff; ' the economy is in shambles, with waste and corruption everywhere; everyone has to share ' their toothbrushes; and traditional religion and families are replaced by worship of ' the State and life in hippie communes.These definitions are mistaken because ' they are insufficiently neutral;almost no one would explicitly endorse ei' ther of ' the systems described, soit's usually a waste of time to use ' these definitions. It's possible that' ' ' ' ' capitalism ' ' ' ' ' (' the academic definition) inevitably leads to ' ' ' ' ' capitalism ' ' ' ' ' (' the mistaken definition), or vice versa for ' ' socialism ' '. But that's an open,empirical question it doesn't mean that one should define '' ' ' ' ' capitalism ' ' ' ' '' or'' ' socialism ' '' that way. 4. Real life examples All large scale societies have had mixed economies : some capitalistic and some socialistic elements.[11]Consequently, it's difficult to look at real life societies and argue that'something about ' them is good or bad because of ' ' ' ' ' capitalism ' ' ' ' ' or ' ' socialism ' '. Wedon't always know which feature to credit or blame. For example, some have argued that ' the primary cause of ' the Great Recession in ' the United States was insufficient re gulation;[12] o' thers have said it was too much government intervention in ' the housing market.[13]Similarly, people might blame ' ' ' ' ' capitalism ' ' ' ' ' or ' ' socialism ' ' for some harm, when ' the system in question was generally capitalistic but ' the harm was caused by a socialistic feature , or vice versa. For example, if a socialist argues that' ' ' ' ' capitalism ' ' ' ' ' is bad because ' the criminal justice system is unfair or inefficient, ' the supporter of ' ' ' ' ' capitalism ' ' ' ' ' can reply that ' the criminal justicesystem is socially controlled. On ' the o' ther side, if a supporter of' ' ' ' ' capitalism ' ' ' ' ' argues that ' ' socialism ' ' is bad because many officials in socialist systems used ' their private property to enrich ' themselves, ' the socialist can reply that that only occurred because ' the system was insufficiently socialistic. 5. Conclusion When important terms are subject to disputed definitions, it's best to specify explicitly which definitions we are referring to. Since ' the defining feature of this debate is ' the question of whe' ther or not people should be able to privately own capital, we should start with ' the academic definitions.  It'sfair to both sides to employ maximally neutral and widely used definitions,and ' then try to answer ' the ethical and social justice question of which arrangement is better.[14]",17 September 2019,Thomas Metcalf

The first essay, on defining ' capitalism ' and ' socialism ', can be viewed here .Suppose I had a magic wand that allowed one to produce 500 donuts per hour. I say to you, “Let's make a deal. You use this wand to produce donuts, and then sell those donuts for 500 and give me the proceeds. I'll give you 10 for every hour you spend doing this. I'll spend that time playing video games.”My activity playing video games seems pretty easy. Your job requires much more effort. And I might end up with a lot more money than 10 for every hour you work. How is that fair In the story, the magic wand is analogous to capital goods : assets(typically machinery and buildings, such as robots, sewing machines,computers, and factories) that make labor, or providing goods and services,more productive. Standard definitions of '' capitalism '' and '' socialism '' indicate that, in general, capitalist systems permit people to privately own and control capital goods, whereas socialist systems do not. And capitalist systems tend to contain widespread wage labor, absentee ownership, and property income; socialist systems generally don't.[1]Capital goods are morally interesting. As in the case of the magic wand,ownership of capital goods can allow one to make lots of money without working. In contrast, other people have to work for a living. This might be unfair or harmful. This essay surveys and explains the main arguments in thisdebate.[2]![Commercial donutmanufacturing.](https://1000wordphilosophy.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/donuts.jpg?w=656)Commercialdonut manufacturing. 1. Capitalism Arguments for ' capitalism ' tend to hold that it's beneficial to society for there to be incentives to produce, own, and use capital goods like the magic wand, or that it's wrong to forcibly prevent people from doing so. Here are four arguments for ' capitalism ', stated briefly:(1) Competition: '' ' ' ' ' When individuals compete with each other for profit's, thisbenefit's the consumer.'[3]Critique : Competition also may encourage selfish and predatory behavior.Competition can also occur in some socialist systems.[4](2) Freedom: '' Preventing people from owning capital restricts their freedom.Seizing their income in the form of taxes may constitute theft.'[5]  Critiques : Maybe owning property, it'self, restricts freedom, by excluding others from using it.[6] If I announce that I own something, I maybe thereby announcing that I will force you not to use it. And maybe freedom requires the ability to pursue one's own goals, which in turn requires some amount of wealth.[7] Further, if people must choose between work and starvation, then their choice to work may not be really free anyway.[8] And the general distribution of wealth is arguably the result of a morally arbitrary natural lottery,”[9] which may not actually confer strict property rights over one's holdings.[10] I didn't choose where I was born, nor my parents '' wealth, nor my natural talents, which allow me to acquire wealth. So perhaps it's not a violation of my rights to take some of that property fromme.(3) Public Goods:[11] '' ' ' ' ' When objects, including capital, must be shared with others, then no one is strongly motivated to produce them. In turn, society is poorer and labor is more difficult ' because production is inefficient.'[12]Critique : People might be motivated to produce capital for altruisticreasons,[13] or may be coerced in some socialist systems to do so. Some putative ly socialist systems allow for profitable production of capitalgoods.[14] (4) Tragedy of the Commons: '' ' ' ' ' When capital, natural resources, or the environment are publicly controlled, no one is strongly motivated to protectthem.'[15]  Critique : As before, people might be motivated by altruism.[16] Some systems with partially private control of capital may nevertheless qualify associalist.[17] 2. Socialism Arguments for ' socialism ' tend to hold that it's unfair or harmful to have a system like in the story of the magic wand, a system with widespread wage labor and property income. Here are four arguments for ' socialism ', statedbriefly:(1) Fairness: 'It's unfair to make money just by owning capital, as is possible only in a capitalist system.'[18]Critique : Perhaps fairness isn't as morally important as consent, freedom,property rights, or beneficial consequences. And perhaps wage laborers consent to work, and capital owners have property rights over their capital.[19](2) Inequality: '' ' ' ' ' When people can privately own capital, they can use it to get even richer relative to the poor, and the wage laborers are left poorer and poorer relative to the rich, thereby worsening the inequality that already exists between capital owners and wage-laborers.'[20]Critiques : This is a disputable empirical claim.[21] And perhaps the ability to privately own capital encourages people to invest in building capital goods, thereby making goods and services cheaper. Further, perhaps monopolies commonly granted by social control over capital are captured by wealthy special-interests,[22] which harm the poor by enacting regressivelaws.[23](3) Labor: '' Wage laborers are alienated from their labor, exploited, and unfree ' because they must obey their bosses' orders.'[24]Critiques : If this alienation and exploitation are net harmful to workers,then why do workers consent to work If the answer is '' because they'll suffer severe hardship otherwise,' then strictly speaking, this is a critique of allowing poverty, not a critique of allowing wage labor.(4) Selfishness: '' ' ' ' ' When people can privately own capital, they selfishly pursue profit above all else, which leads to further inequality, environmental degradation, non productive industries, economic instability, colonialism,mass murder, and slavery.'Critique : These are also disputable empirical claims. Maybe when people are given control over socially owned capital, they selfishly extract personal wealth from it.[25] Maybe when the environment is socially controlled,everyone is individually motivated to over harvest and pollute.[26] State intervention in the economy may be a major cause of the existence of non productive industry, pollution, and economic instability.[27] Last, some of the worst perpetrators of historical evils are governments, not privatecorporations.[28]  3. Conclusion It is difficult to justifiably draw general conclusions about what a pure' capitalism ' or ' socialism ' would be like in practice.[29] But an examination of the merit's and demerit's of each system gives us some guidance about whether we should move a society in either direction.",17 September 2019,Thomas Metcalf

210,https://1000wordphilosophy.wordpress.com/2015/05/13/karl-marxs-conception-of-alienation/,"Karl Marx's thought is wide ranging and has had a massive influence in,especially, philosophy and sociology. Marx is best known for his two unsparing critiques of capitalism.The first of these critiques maintains that capitalism is essentially alienating. The second of these critiques maintains that capitalism is essentially  exploitative.1This essay focuses specifically on Marx's theory of alienation, which rests onMarx's specific claims about both economics and human nature.![factories-at-asnieres-seen-from-the-quai-de-clichy-1887(1)](https://1000wordphilosophy.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/factories-at-asnieres-seen-from-the-quai-de-clichy-18871.jpg?w=656) 1. Marx's Analysis of Capitalism For Marx, the idea of the means of production is a crucial economic category. The means of production include nearly everything needed to produce commodities, including natural resources, factories, and machinery. In a capitalist economy, as opposed to a communist or socialist economy, the means of production are privately owned, as when a businessperson owns a factory.The key element not included as part of the means of production is labor.2As a result, members of the capitalist economy find themselves divided into two distinct classes: those who own the means of production (the capitalist class 3 or bourgeoisie ) and those worker's who do not (the proletariat ). 2. Marx's Concept of Species Being For Marx, whether capitalism and its class division is a suitable arrangement for human beings depends on human nature.Because humans are biological beings, and not merely free floating immaterial minds, we, like all other biological beings, must interact with and transform the natural world in order to survive.4 But what distinguishes us from all other animals, like bees, spiders, or beavers, which all transform the world based on instinct, is that we transform the world consciously and freely.5Thus, the essence of a human being – what Marx calls our species being – is to consciously and freely transform the world in order to meet our needs. Like many other philosophers, Marx believes that excellently doing what makes us distinctively human is the true source of fulfillment. 3. Alienation in Capitalist Society We can now make clear Marx's claim that capitalism is alienating.The general idea of alienation is simple: something is alienating when what is (or should be) familiar and connected comes to seem foreign or disconnected. Because our species being is our essence as human beings, it should be something that is familiar. To the extent that we are unable to actin accordance with our species being, we become disconnected from our own nature. So if work in a capitalist society inhibits the realization of ourspecies being, then work is to that extent alienating.6 And since we are being alienated from our own nature, alienation is not merely a subjective feeling,but is about an objective reality.So how are worker's alienated from their species being under capitalism Marx distinguishes three specific ways.7  1.   Workers are alienated from other human beings. In a capitalist economy, worker's must compete with each other for jobs and raises. But just as competition between businesses brings down the price of commodities, competition between worker's brings down wages. And so it is not the proletariat who benefits from this competition, but capitalists. This is not only materially damaging to worker's, it estranges them from each other. Humans are free beings and are able to not only transform the world themselves, but to cooperate in order to transform the world in more sophisticated and helpful ways. As such, they should see each other as allies, especially in the face of a capitalist class who seeks to undermine worker solidarity for its own benefit. But under capitalism worker's see each other as opposing competition.  2.   Workers are alienated from the products of their labor. Capitalists need not do any labor themselves – simply by owning the means of production, they control the profit of the firm they own, and are enriched by it. But they can only make profit by selling commodities, which are entirely produced by worker's.8 Thus, the products of the worker's labor strengthen the capitalists, whose interests are opposed to that of the proletariat. Workers do this as laborers, but also as consumers: Whenever laborers buy commodities from capitalists, that also strengthens the position of the capitalists. This again stands in opposition to the worker's' species being. Humans produce in response to our needs; but for the proletariat at least, strengthening the capitalist class is surely not one of those needs.  3.   Workers are alienated from the act of labor. Because capitalists own the firms that employ worker's, it is they, not the worker's, who decide what commodities are made, how they are made, and in what working conditions they are made. As a result, work is often dreary, repetitive, and even dangerous. Such work may be suitable for machines, or beings without the ability to consciously and freely decide how they want to work, but it is not suitable for human beings. Enduring this for an extended period of time means that one can only look for fulfillment outside of one's work; while the activity of working, which is potentially the source of human self definition and human freedom, is … degraded to a necessity for staying alive.”9 As Marx puts it in a famous passage:[I]n his work, therefore, he [the laborer 10] does not affirm himself but denies himself, does not feel content but unhappy, does not develop freely his physical and mental energy but mortifies his body and ruins his mind. The worker therefore only feels himself outside of work, and in his work feels outside himself. He is at home when he is not working, and when he is working he is not at home.11If Marx is right about all of this, then contemporary complaints about the degrading nature of work are not hyperbole. Insofar as capitalism prevents us from realizing our own species being, it is, quite literally, dehumanizing. 4. Conclusion One may find great inspiration in the idea that true fulfillment can come from creative and meaningful work. Yet most people's actual experience of work in capitalist economies is characterized by tedium, apathy, and exhaustion.Marx's theory of alienation provides a conceptual framework for understanding the nature and cause of these experiences, and assures us that these subjective experiences are about an objective reality – and, crucially, areality we can change.",13 May 2015,No author
